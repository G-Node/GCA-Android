## Special Events
### The Funder’s Hour
Wednesday, September 13, 17:30 h 
Venue: Central Lecture Hall (ZHG), first floor, room 105 
with Barbara Pauly (HFSP Director of Fellowships) and Jérémie Barral (NYU, Long-Term Fellow)
HFSP: Funding International Research Collaborations in the Life Sciences

Computational and theoretical neuroscience can open up novel avenues towards understanding the nervous system by integrating methods and concepts of natural sciences, life science and engineering. This year’s Bernstein Conference features The Funder’s Hour to provide an exchange forum for funding agencies, which support such trans-disciplinary frontier research and the computational neuroscience community.  The Funder’s Hour 2017 will present the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP). HFSP has been supporting frontier research on the complex mechanisms of living organisms since 1990. HFSP Director of Fellowships Barbara Pauly will describe HFSP’s funding aims and principles (HFSP: Funding International Research Collaborations in the Life Sciences). HFSP Long-Term Fellow Jérémie Barral (NYU) will report about his HFSP experience and show some highlights of his HFSP funded research (Synaptic scaling to maintain neuronal dynamics and propagate information). The short presentations will be followed by a moderated questions and answers session.

### Public Lecture (in German)
Wednesday, September 13, 20:00 h
Venue: Alte Mensa, Wilhelmsplatz 3, 37073 Goettingen
Niels Birbaumer
Abolishment of the locked-in state with a Brain-Machine-Interface (BMI)
Gehirn-Maschine-Verbindungen: Wem nutzen sie?

Completely locked-in patients (CLIS) cannot communicate with any motor response despite intact cognitive and emotional response systems. Four ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) patients in CLIS  learned to respond with a brain oxygenation and deoxygenation change of frontal brain areas using portable NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy) to short questions requiring a yes or no response presented auditorily within 15 seconds. CLIS duration in the four patients has lasted from 4 months to eight years and was validated with EOG measurement during all sessions. Each session contained 20 to 60 questions (half with yes and half with no answers). All experiments take place at the home of patients. Questions with known answers were used to train a support vector machine classifier (SVM). After achieving 70% correct answers open questions were asked and feedback of the classified answer was provided to the patients. EEG from 6 electrodes served to control sleep and vigilance decrement: questions were interrupted if sleep-like patterns appeared. 16 to 60 sessions over several months assured stability of communication with an average correct response rate of more than 70% to known and 90% correct answers to open questions. Among open questions quality of life questions were asked on a weekly basis to three of the patients with longer CLIS duration, all patients report good quality of life as previously reported by our group. Open questions answers are validated by stability over time, information of family and care takers, sentences with semantic errors and face validity (i.e. pain questions during periods of intense pain due to decubitus and other illness related problems). These results suggest that brain machine interfaces using metabolic brain signals may end the unbearable silence of CLIS.

### Brains for Brains Award 2017
The Brains for Brains Award is an initiative of the Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience. Since 2010, the Brains for Brains Award honors outstanding young international scientists who achieved a peer-reviewed scientific publication before starting their doctoral thesis. It consists of a travel fellowship of 2,000 € covering their trip to Germany, participation in the Bernstein Conference and two individually planned visits to selected Computational Neuroscience labs in Germany. The 2017 awardee will present a poster during the poster session on Thursday, September 14. This year’s award will go to Elise Genevieve Rowe (Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). She will give a short talk during the award ceremony on Friday, September 15


## Bernstein Network Computational Neuroscience Information Booth 
The Bernstein Network is a research network in the field of computational neuroscience; this field brings together experimental approaches in neurobiology with theoretical models and computer simulations. The network started in 2004 with a funding initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research to promote the transfer of theoretical insight into clinical and technical applications. Today, after 10 years of funding by the Federal Ministry, the Bernstein Network has over 200 research groups. It is named after the German physiologist and biophysicist Julius Bernstein (1839-1917).
The Bernstein Network comprises three central facilities, which are represented at the information booth:
Bernstein Coordination Site (BCOS)
BCOS is the connecting link to partners in science, industry, politics and the general public. It oversees a large information pool and can provide valuable networking resources. 
BCOS activities are aimed at facilitating scientific encounter, supporting young researchers and public outreach. The SMARTSTART Joint Training Program in Computational Neuroscience, which is coordinated by BCOS, prepares young researchers for a career in computational neuroscience. Information on all services can be gained during poster sessions. 

## German Node of the International Neuroinformatics Coordination Facility (G-Node)
During the conference, the G-Node presents their new data management service GIN. GIN is a free service for managing, sharing, and publishing research data. It features versioned storage, multi-user access for collaboration, and publishing of data using persistent identifiers (DOI). The G-Node invites all conference participants to try out the new service: bring your data, discuss your data management needs, hear about upcoming features. Demos will be given during poster sessions and coffee breaks. Walk-ins are welcome any time during the conference.

## Bernstein Facility for Simulation and Database Technology (SimLab Neuroscience)
High Performance Computing (HPC) can help your neuroscience projects. SimLab Neuroscience, at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre, provides advanced support in the fields of data analysis, modeling, simulation, HPC methods and visualization. It also offers tutorials, workshops, and courses to help you make the transition to HPC. 
Come and meet us at the booth and find out what the Bernstein Facilities can do for you.

## Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience
The Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience supports research and education in computational neuroscience and reaches out to the general public to bring across research topics and current findings. The Bernstein Association was founded in 2009 by members of the Bernstein Network and is recognized as a non-profit organization. Everyone who is active in the field of computational neuroscience or related subjects can become a member of the Bernstein Association. The general assembly usually takes place at the annual Bernstein Conference. More information can be found at the Bernstein Network Information Booth or on the website (www.nncn.de/en/bernstein-association)
