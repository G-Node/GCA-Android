Special Events
==============
Bernstein Award for Computational Neuroscience 2014
---------------------------------------------------
Since 2006, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) annually confers the Bernstein Award for Computational Neuroscience to one excellent junior researcher with outstanding ideas for new research projects. The award is endowed with up to 1,25 million € over the course of five years and is one of the most highly remunerated research awards for young scientists in Germany. With this funding, the awardees can establish their own, independent research group at a research institution of their choice in Germany.

The Bernstein Award will be conferred by Dr. Georg Schuette (State Secretary at the BMBF) within the opening session of the Bernstein Conference 2014, on September 3. Following the award ceremony, the awardee will present his/her current research and future projects to be conducted with the support of the award.

Valentino Braitenberg Award for Computational Neuroscience 2014
---------------------------------------------------------------
The award is named after Prof. Dr. Valentino Braitenberg (1926, Bozen – 2011, Tübingen), one of the founding directors of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. With his novel research approach that combined anatomy, physiology, and theory, Valentino Braitenberg was a pioneer of the modern research discipline Computational Neuroscience and has significantly contributed to the development of biological cybernetics, which has in turn inspired robotics and artificial intelligence.  On the occasion of her father’s 65th birthday, Carla Braitenberg, together with Max Gulin, created a Golden Neuron to be awarded in subsequent year as a challenge trophy for outstanding scientific achievements. Since 2012, this tradition has been continued in a modified form. With financial support of the “Autonome Provinz Bozen Südtirol” the Valentino Braitenberg Award is now biannually conferred within the framework of the Bernstein Conference. On Wednesday, September 3, Ad Aertsen will present this year’s award to Alexander Borst (Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany).


Brains for Brains Awards 2014
-----------------------------
The Brains for Brains Award is an initiative of the Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience, supported by external donors. This year’s award is kindly supported by Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, circular Informationssysteme GmbH, Stuttgart, and npi electronic GmbH, Tamm. Since 2010, the Brains for Brains Award honors outstanding young international scientists who achieved a peer-reviewed scientific publication before starting their doctoral thesis. It consists of a 500 € cash prize and a travel fellowship of up to 2,000 € covering their trip to Germany, participation in the Bernstein Conference and two individually planned visits to selected Computational Neuroscience labs in Germany. During the award ceremony on Thursday, September 4, the 2014 awardee gives a brief teaser about his poster that will be presented during the subsequent poster session. This year’s award will go to Ben Shababo (UC Berkeley, USA)

Public Lecture (in German) 	19:30 h

Humanoid Robotics: From household assistants to personalized robot suits
Tamim Asfour, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany  

Ambitious goals have been set for humanoid robots: They are expected to be companions and assistants for people in different ages and environments, helpers in man-made and natural disasters, and winners against the world soccer champion in 2050.

The talk will first address recent progress towards building integrated 24/7 humanoid robots able to perform complex grasping and manipulation tasks in daily environments, to autonomously acquire object knowledge through active visual and haptic exploration and to learn actions from human observation and to imitate actions in a goal-directed manner. In the second part of the talk T. Asfour will discuss the transformative impact of humanoid robotic on other research areas and application fields, where humanoid robots become 24/7 wearable companions for augmentation or replacing of human performance in daily and working environments, where wearable humanoid technologies contribute to a personalized rehabilitation in medicine, support and protect humans in human-made and natural disasters.

PhD Student Event
-----------------
Tuesday, September 2
Public Lecture (in English) 	19:00 - 22:00 h

Mind the gap: Can the puzzle of consciousness be solved?	

Joseph Levine, University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA 
Giulio Tononi, University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine, Madison, USA

We will start this evening event with two 45 min talks by Prof. Dr. Joseph Levine and Prof. Dr. Giulio Tononi. Prof. Levine is a philosopher who has been working on philosophy of the mind and the problem of consciousness for the last 30 years. He argues that a so called explanatory gap separates the realm of physical phenomena and the realm of phenomenal experiences. Prof. Tononi is a neuroscientist and psychiatrist. He is one of the inventors of the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness and his ideas might pave the road towards a quantification and scientific understanding of consciousness.
Following the two talks, we will have a panel discussion, including questions from the audience. The event is open to the general public.
