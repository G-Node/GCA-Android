        "text": "Introduction\"\"\"\"Music listening is effective at recruiting a wide range of areas in the brain [1]. The decoding approach, that aims to describe stimuli or conditions in terms of changes in the neural activations [2], has been employed to investigate the neural processing of musical features using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during naturalistic music listening. A modest accuracy has been reached at predicting low- and high-level musical features [3]. The accuracy levels suggest subject-specific differences in the neural processing of musical material. In one of the few studies on subject-specific differences in the neural recruitment during music listening, [4] linked musical training to an increased functional symmetry in multiple regions of the brain. Decoding demographic attributes, such as psychiatric conditions, based on the whole-brain connectivity has received increased attention [5]. However, this type of approach has not been employed with musical stimuli and musically relevant variables, such as musicianship. Moreover, past research has not attempted to model subject-specific differences on the basis of the patterns of brain responses to music stimulus features. The present study aims to decode musicianship based on the neural processing of musical features in naturalistic music listening.\"\"\"\"Materials and Methods\"\"\"\"FMRI data acquisition and preprocessing\"\"\"\"An equal number of musically trained (n=18) and untrained (n=18) participants participated in an fMRI experiment. This data has previously been used in [4]. Three musical pieces covering distinct musical genres were used: (i) Stream of Consciousness by Dream Theater (rock/metal); (ii) Adios Nonino by Astor Piazzolla (tango); and (iii) Rite of Spring Part I, episodes 1-3 (classical music) by Igor Stravinsky. Participants’ brain responses were acquired while they attentively listened to each of the musical stimuli. Scanning was performed using a whole-body scanner, and slices covering the whole brain were acquired at 0.5Hz. fMRI data was preprocessed as in [4]. Last, the fMRI volumes were parcellated into 116 regions according to the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. The regional mean time-series were estimated by within-region voxel averaging.\"\"\"\"Musical feature processing\"\"\"\"An approach similar to that in [1] was employed for musical feature extraction and processing. 25 musical features related to timbre, rhythm and tonality were extracted from the stimuli using the MIRToolbox [6]. The temporal evolution of features was extracted using a time frame-based approach. To make the data comparable with the fMRI data, each of the features were convolved with a double-gamma Hemodynamic Response Function, de-trended by spline interpolation and temporal filtering, and down-sampled to 0.5Hz. The musical features were then subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax rotation to map the data to six components labeled as Fullness, Brightness, Activity, Timbral Complexity, Pulse Clarity, and Key Clarity.\"\"\"\"Decoding\"\"\"\"A multi-stage modeling approach was employed for the decoding. First, the region-based fMRI data for all participants was concatenated in time, and each region was z-score transformed to zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Group-PCA [7] with a low number of components was run on the data to smooth out noise and to reduce the data dimensionality. Separately for each participant, the data was then time-aligned with the musical features, cross-covariance was computed between the regions and features, and the resulting matrix for each participant was vectorized. Then, the z-score transformation was performed over participants was performed. L1-norm penalized linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained to predict the musicianship from the cross-covariances, as it is robust against irrelevant features. The cost parameter controlling the number of retained features was optimized for each model in an inner cross-validation (CV) loop.\"\"\"\"To obtain realistic decoding performance estimates, an outer CV loop across participants was run ten times following the leave-one-subject-per-group-out (LOSGO) strategy [5]. Random partitioning of the participants was used at each run and the obtained accuracies were pooled. The three musical stimuli were concatenated in time for the main analysis, appropriating an overall view of the neural processing related to multiple musical styles.\"\"\"\"Results and Discussion\"\"\"\"The classification accuracy (FIG1) obtained with the concatenated stimulus depended on the number of principal components used, reaching the peak at three components (M=0.681, SD=0.026). This accuracy is statistically significant at p < 0.05 based on Monte-Carlo sampling. When training and testing with each individual stimulus (FIG2), the mean classification accuracy did not reach the significance level of p=0.05 except for Piazzolla at three components. This may indicate the lack of variability in the musical material within these stimuli, leading to less stable covariances.\"\"\"\"The contribution of different neural regions and musical features in the optimal models (three components, concatenated stimulus) were assessed by examining the feature coefficients in the SVM models as well as the principal component loadings, averaged across the CV runs and folds. The most important features predicting group membership included increased activation in the auditory network in musicians and in the salience network in non-musicians during moments of high timbral complexity and low fullness (PC3). This may indicate musicians' greater ability to efficiently process complex musical material. Furthermore, moments of high activation and unclear tonality were associated with higher activation in the executive control and salience networks and frontal regions in musicians (PC2). This may suggest that musicians, because of their training, were performing more efficient tonal prediction. Finally, high overall activation during moments of high brightness was found to predict musicianship (PC1). This may indicate higher efficiency of timbral processing in musicians.\"\"\"\"Conclusions\"\"\"\"A moderately high accuracy was achieved at decoding musicianship from neural processing of musical features, and distinct processing patterns at various brain areas for different musical features were discovered between musicians and non-musicians. This suggests a profound connection between musical training and music perception. This also highlights the need to take into account the demographic attributes when studying music processing in the field of neuroinformatics. However, a modest and unstable accuracy achieved with stimuli representing individual musical styles warrants further study on the effect of musical styles on music perception and processing.",

        "text": "SpineML is a declarative XML-based format for the description of neural network models. It is based on the INCF NineML format[1]. SpineCreator[2] is an editor for the SpineML format which allows a researcher to define and lay out a model graphically, rather than using coded instructions. In addition to defining the model components and network, SpineCreator allows the definition of “experiments”, which declare how the model should be executed; inputs, outputs to log, model lesions and model property changes are all defined in the SpineML experiment. SpineML_2_BRAHMS[3] is one of several simulation backends for a SpineML model (others are SpineML_2_GeNN[4] & Damson[5]). SpineML_2_BRAHMS makes use of the BRAHMS[6,7] middleware to simulate the model on conventional CPUs and high performance computer systems. SpineML_2_BRAHMS is a set of scripts which first converts the SpineML declaration of a model's neuron components into C++, and the model's network into a BRAHMS system definition. SpineML_2_BRAHMS then compiles the C++ representation of the components and executes the system using BRAHMS. Collectively, this set of software is referred to as the SpineML toolchain.\n\nWe will demonstrate several ways to work with a pure SpineML model, including the use of the SpineCreator editor, direct modification of the SpineML XML code and programmatic modification of the model using Jupyter[8] notebooks. We will discuss the use of revision control systems, such as git[9], to manage changes to a model. A common workflow is to modify the model using SpineCreator, push changes (with comments) to a git repository, then pull the updated SpineML model description onto an HPC system for execution using SpineML_2_BRAHMS.  Existing rate-coded and spiking models of basal ganglia from our research group will be used as examples.\n\nOne challenge, which we have been working on within the EU-funded NoTremor project, is how to integrate brain and neuro-muscular models to enable the combined model to demonstrate physical behaviour. Here, we make use of features in BRAHMS which permit the integration of a biomechanical eye within the SpineML toolchain. This allows brain and brainstem SpineML models to drive the motoneuron activations which control the eye's movement. The eye's rotational state is fed back into the brain model making a closed-loop system. This large model, which contains retina, cortex, superior colliculus, basal ganglia and brainstem oculomotor populations, forms an good example of the utility of using a graphical model editor. It also provides a platform to discuss multi-scale modelling in which a portion of the model may be replaced with a more detailed implementation to compare behaviours.",

        "text": "Neuroscientists perform complex experiments aiming to reach a more effective understanding about the functioning of the brain and the treatment of its pathologies. Each research laboratory uses different techniques and methodologies to produce and to analyze its findings. These experiments generate large volumes of data in diverse formats. Furthermore, with the increasing of the scale of research projects, many research laboratories are confronted with new technical (e.g. data size, quality control, analysis complexity, guaranteed reproducibility) and social (e.g. employee turnover, data sharing requirements) challenges [1]. This scenario imposes the use of computational tools to document each step of the experiments and to facilitate the electronic data capture. Addressing this problem, we present the Neuroscience Experiments System (NES), a software to manage data from neuroscience experiments.\nNES is a web-based system that provides facilities to record data and metadata from each step of a neuroscience experiment in a secure and user friendly platform. It was developed to assist researchers in their data collecting routine throughout a neuroscience experiment, integrating data records from different types such as clinical, electrophysiological, imaging, and behavioral. Furthermore, it provides a unified repository (database) for the experimental data of an entire research laboratory, group, or project. Its web interface and modular format provide an intuitive use of its data management functionalities. Its use does not depend on any specific knowledge on informatics. NES is a free software tool, developed using open technologies and tools which can be easily installed and used in any research laboratory.\nNES was developed to keep together experimental data and its fundamental provenance information, defined by the seven W's (Who, What, Where, Why, When, Which, (W) how) [2]. Examples of provenance information maintained by NES are: information about the scientists responsible for the experiment and collection of data and the description of the subject groups (who); the details about the recording protocol or behavioral data collection (e.g. the types of data collection performed) (what); the details of the experimental protocol used in the collection of primary data (how); the start/end date-time for data collection (when); the purpose of the experiment (why); the information about the experimental conditions to which the groups of subjects are submitted, such as tasks to perform and stimulus to apply (which); the information about the laboratory where data was collected (where) and even publications or other results that have arisen from the study of the collected data. Scientists can also record additional details for each experiment’s volunteer, such as the information about his/her clinical history and sociodemographic data.\nIn NES, each primary data acquired from an experiment is always associated to a study participant and to a specific step of the experimental protocol. For this reason, before storing the primary data collected in an experiment, the researcher needs to record in detail each step involved in the experimental protocol (e.g., the specific preparation for the realization of the experiment). The experimental protocol is described as a workflow, that can contain both sequential and parallel steps. With this, NES provides a structured and comprehensive platform with a robust tracking of data provenance that is fundamental to enable the reproduction of the experiment.\nIt is worth to mention that NES is not a new proposal to standardize the experimental data representation. There are several models and formats (e.g. NeoHDF5 [3], NWB [4], NIX [5]) currently in development to address this issue.  These models are appropriate for organizing and exchanging data of a particular type and from a particular experiment. However, they do not replace the function of a database. A database system keeps large data volumes and provides functionalities for access control, data consistency, fault tolerance and efficient data recovery. Furthermore, on a database it is possible to store the relationships among different types of data from different experiments, allowing for more sophisticate data analysis which are specially valuable to support advances in the healthcare domain.\nThe data model used in NES is aligned with several formats used in neuroscience, enabling interoperability with the most promising initiatives for standardization of data representation for electrophysiology and neuroimaging, as much as with guidelines to report neuroscience experiments (e.g., MINI [6]; MINEMO [7]; fMRI [8]). Currently, NES is able to manage several types of electrophysiological data and metadata used by the neuroscience community, and the neuroimaging module is under development. To handle the heterogeneity of experimental data, NES adopts a polyglot persistence strategy, combining different kinds of storage technologies, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases and distributed file systems.\nNES is an initiative of the Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (NeuroMat), hosted at University of São Paulo, Brazil. It is licensed under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 and its source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/neuromat/nes. One of the goals of NeuroMat is to establish in Brazil a leading research group in Neuroinformatics, specialized in curating experimental data. With the development of free software tools such as NES, we want to encourage and support the collection of high-quality data and metadata and the creation of more open databases in the Neurosciences area.",

        "text": "Managing neuroscience data requires the integration of information from multiple sources. Background information, or metadata, about the experiment is necessary to interpret the resulting data correctly. Storing such information consistently is an essential part of experimental research and depends crucially on available file formats. Many existing formats provide only limited support for linking metadata to the data. Here we present the NIX project[1], consisting of an open format and software tools to store and organize data and metadata. The format can store recorded or derived data together with the meta-information, including relationships between data items. Units and dimension information are stored alongside the data to make quick interpretation possible. The format further allows specifying regions of interest, such as areas in an image or events in a recorded signal. Efficient use of NIX features is facilitated by software libraries for different languages, including C++, Python, Matlab, and Java. Installable packages exist for different platforms, together with documentation, examples, and tutorials. Additionally the NixView program[2] can be used to explore, plot and export the stored data in a user friendly and convenient way. An I/O backend for NEO[3,4] has been implemented, creating a route for raw data in various proprietary formats to be converted to the open NIX format via the NEO data structures. Moreover, results of data analysis done with NEO, e.g. using the Elephant[5] toolkit, can be saved in the very same format. The NIX project thus supports comprehensive annotation and efficient organisation of neuroscience data, and the variety of libraries makes it easy to integrate access to data and metadata in the lab data collection and analysis workflow.",

        "text": "The importance of simulator-independent high-level model-description languages for model building, sharing, and integration in computational neuroscience has been well established. Simulator independence is essential to ensure that complex models are both testable and reproducible. However the adoption of standardisation has been hampered by the current difficulty of developing and visualising Layered XML models, due to a lack of intuitive model creation tools.\n\nConcurrently, the development of increasingly complex and comprehensive simulations, such as whole-brain emulation, require a shift to massively parallel programming paradigms.  GPU utilization has proven to be a powerful tool for reducing execution times of  the large-scale models required for rapid hypothesis generation and testing. Problematically, while parallel programming is a powerful tool, it is notoriously difficult and time consuming for non-experts to develop efficient, portable and testable code.\n\nThis requirement for efficient GPU-level programming presents a further barrier to entry for open-science, due to both the increased financial burden of GPU infrastructure, and the specialized knowledge needed for proficiency specific GPU programming paradigms. This in turn negatively impacts the progress model sharing and integration.\n\nHere we describe a complete GUI to GPU tool chain based on SpineML (Richmond et al, 2014) , a LEMS derived layered neural modeling language (Cannon et al. 2014), and the associated graphical user interface, SpineCreator. We demonstrate easy development of large scale neural networks, with support for both CPU and GPU code generation. We prototype both local and remote code execution, encouraging large-scale, parallel-execution of standardised model specifications, with seamless model sharing. We demonstrate the capability of running these models both on local hardware, and with easily set up cloud computing services, enabling GPU utilization, without requiring the considerable time and financial investments associated with GPU development and maintenance.\n\nAs an important model for neurological investigation, with a large genetic tool-base, we focus here on the Drosophila model organism, and utilise the Neurokernel GPU based simulation platform (Givon et al. (2016)), aimed at facilitating easy model integration through modularly defined drosophila Local Processing Units (LPUs).  To enable model translation from XML to GPU code we developed the libSpineML python library as a pythonic interface to the model description, to facilitate programmatic model creation and translation into executable Neurokernel modules.\n\nUsing this programmatic SpineML interface, we developed the toolchain to transform arbitrary neuron components into CUDA kernels (Goodman et al. (2010)), which can run in massively parallel network simulations natively in the Neurokernel GPU framework.  Building on this modular pipeline, we show how locally created high level network specifications can be compiled down to efficient CUDA code to be executed locally, or remotely. We detail a novel web-interface and framework for GPU-cloud computing access, further reducing the barrier to entry to massively parallel neural simulations.\n\nWhat results is a flexible, powerful, and open-standard based toolchain which empowers intuitive graphical neuroscientific simulation design, with seamless dynamic GPU code generation. This combination of large scale massively-parallel simulations, with graphical creation tools and remote execution through cloud access, will simultaneously reduced the barrier to entry for GPU-enabled simulations, and significantly improve the development process for the sharable, testable and reproducible models required in successful open science initiatives.",

        "text": "Protein phosphorylation is involved in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways and physiological functions in the nervous system. While recent advances in mass spectrometry based proteomics allowed us to identify approximately 200,000 phosphorylation sites [1], it is not fully understood which sites are phosphorylated by a specific kinase and which extracellular stimuli regulate the protein phosphorylation via intracellular signaling cascades. To uncover the basic issue, we developed a new methodology for comprehensive screening of the target phosphorylation sites of a given kinase (or extracellular signal) [2,3]. In this demonstration, we present an on-line database system that provides the phosphorylation signals identified by our developed methodology as well as those previously reported in the literature.\nThe database system and its web portal were built based on the Next Generation XooNIps [4], and named “KANPHOS (Kinase-Associated PHOspho-Signaling).” All data are controlled for quality via review and curation by our professional staffs. In the portal site, we can search for the data of interest in three ways: 1) Search for substrates phosphorylated by a specific kinase; 2) Search for kinases phosphorylating a specific protein; and 3) Search for kinases and their target substrates by a specific signaling pathway. Each substrate is associated with basic information provided by the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) such as protein and gene name synonyms and description about physiological functions. Also, to allow the users for cross-searching with minimal efforts, each entry has hyperlinks to external databases (e.g. KEGG PATHWAY Database, GeneCards, and Allen Brain Atlas).\nFor the sustainability of the database, we launched the KANPHOS Platform in INCF Japan Node in April, 2016. We will discuss future challenges of this platform and collaboration plans with other platforms in the demonstration.",

        "text": "INCF japan Node (J-Node) has developed 14 neuroinformatics platforms. For the sake of integrative use of these databases, J-Node is now focusing on development of tools and systems for data-sharing.\nMain resources of the recent development are as follows.\n\n1) XooNIps ver 4. was applied to INCF Japan Node Portal and several platforms. The new version supports user friendly custamization of metada.  By using this, we have created DOI registration support system for J-Node research contents. DOI  registration of research data in the test project in 2015 is followed by a regular phase on J-Node Portal.\n\n2) Digital Brain Atlasing and semantic web were developed in collaboration among PF members. Recent activities were created at j-Node Hackathon. A number of web viewer for integrating brain atlas and related knowledge were created to promote data exchange among platforms and related projects.\n\n3) The use of ontology for semantic web technology is one of INCF core activities. J-Node tries to incorporate J-Node contents in future integrated knowledge as semantic web. RIKEN developed RIKEN Meta Database in the use of Resource Description Framework, where some of J-Node Platforms was registered. Ontologies and tools covering across platforms and related projects are now under further elucidation.\n\n4) To promote software/tool development as collaborative projects, we launched INCF Japan Node software center. We updated the center to include software catalog site and software development site. This center is partially open in public for everyone's use.\n\nBased on these infrastructures, J-Node tries to integrate knowledge on not only domestic but also international neuroscience and neuroinformatics.",

        "text": "Neuroscientists are accumulating data at unprecedented rates through large-scale initiatives such as the Human Brain Project (www.humanbrainproject.eu), the Allen Institute (www.alleninstitute.org) and the Japan Brain/MINDS Project (http://brainminds.jp/en/) which deposit their findings into publicly available databases. Gaining insight from this data requires modelling, analysis and sharing of results in a similarly transparent and reproducible way. However, complex installation requirements and a lack of programming experience may hinder the adoption of such modelling practices, to the detriment of our understanding of the brain. The work presented here aims to overcome these barriers to adoption through the paradigm of “Modelling as a Service” (MaaS), whereby the necessary tools are ready and waiting as a webpage in the cloud.\nAs a proof-of-concept of the MaaS paradigm for more accessible modelling, we developed an online portal for optogenetics dubbed Prometheus (http://try.projectpyrho.org), based on PyRhO, our computational tools for fitting and simulating opsins [1]. PyRhO has already been integrated with several popular simulation environments including NEURON [2, 3] and Brian2 [4, 5], allowing simulations to be run on multiple scales (from channel to network) and includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on IPython widgets. Given the surge in popularity of Python as a programming language in neuroscience, due to its expressiveness, readability, and wealth of open-source modules [6], this was a natural foundation on which to build Prometheus.\nMore recently, the IPython/Jupyter project [7] has evolved into a browser-based notebook interface where the inputs and outputs of the modelling process are all embedded into the same webpage (along with a wide variety of other rich web content). This auto-documenting approach to simulation and analysis has been identified as an especially promising medium for promoting sharing and reproducibility in computational neuroscience [8]. As such, these technologies were natural choices for creating a browser-based modelling platform. This approach was further enhanced by the development of tmpnb which handles authentication for multiple simultaneous users, spawning separate (temporary) notebooks for each in secure Docker sandbox environments. This system is built upon a Linux server using an entirely open-source software stack to build a robust, responsive and easily replicable system, which may be rapidly deployed for both research and teaching.\n\n[Please insert Figure 1 about here]\nFigure 1: Screenshot of the PyRhO notebook GUI (in expanded view). The run bar is shown at the top with controls for running simulations and the step protocol tab is shown below where parameters of the stimulation protocol may be adjusted.\n\nWe demonstrate Prometheus: a working web-based portal, configured with all the necessary Python dependencies preinstalled, such that they may be used on any computer with nothing more than a web browser and an internet connection. Like other online portals, this approach eliminates problems associated with local installations, such as lack of administrative permissions, version incompatibilities and unsupported operating systems to name a few. Unlike other portals, the notebook interface is lightweight, interactive and provides the opportunity to be controlled entirely through an intuitive GUI composed of familiar widgets (see Figure 1). We illustrate the advantages of such a system in terms of its interactivity, convenience and scope for easily sharing and reproducing models and analyses.\nThe work presented greatly simplifies the use of modelling software, providing a readily accessible alternative to local installations for quick trials without the need to download, install or configure any new software. Eventually we aim to grow this project in scope to encompass other modelling and analysis tools, and migrate to Jupyter Hub for persistent individual user accounts and storage. In the meantime, we hope that this approach will serve to demonstrate how MaaS can substantially increase the appeal and accessibility of modelling, especially for scientists with a limited computational background.",

        "text": "SciCrunch was designed to allow communities of researchers create their own focused portals that provide access to resources, information, databases and tools of relevance to their research areas. A data portal that searches across hundreds of databases and information resources can be created in minutes. Communities can choose from our existing SciCrunch data sources and also add their own.  SciCrunch was designed to break down the traditional types of portal silos created by different communities, so that communities can take advantage of work done by others and share their expertise as well.  When a community brings in a data source, it becomes available to other communities, thus ensuring that valuable resources are shared by other communities who might need them.  At the same time, individual communities can customize the way that these resources are presented to their constituents, to ensure that their user base is served.  To ensure proper credit and to help share expertise, all resources are tagged by the communities that create them and those that access them.\n\nExploring Information and Data:\nSciCrunch is one of the largest aggregations of scientific data and tools available on the Web.  One can think of SciCrunch as a “PubMed” for tools and data.  Just as you can search across all the biomedical literature through PubMed, regardless of journal, SciCrunch lets you search across hundreds of databases and information resources and millions of data records from a single interface. SciCrunch enhances search with semantic technologies to ensure we bring you all the results.  SciCrunch provides three primary searchable collections:  the SciCrunch Registry and the SciCrunch Data Federation.\n\n* SciCrunch Registry – is a curated catalog of thousands of research resources (data, tools, materials, services, organizations, core facilities), focusing on freely-accessible resources available to the scientific community.  Each research resource is categorized by resource type and given a unique identifier.  SciCrunch also provides information on resource mentions in the literature and provides alerts when new publications mention a resource.\n\n* SciCrunch Data Federation – a data discovery index that provides deep query across the contents of databases created and maintained by independent individuals and organizations.  Each database is aligned to the SciCrunch semantic framework, to allow users to browse the contents of these databases quickly and efficiently.  Users are then taken to the source database for further exploration.  SciCrunch deploys a unique data ingestion platform that makes it easy for database providers to make their resources available to SciCrunch.  Using this technology, SciCrunch currently makes available more than 200 independent databases, comprising hundreds of millions of data records.  To keep up to date on specific searches or resources, SciCrunch provides alerting services when new information or data is found.\n\n* SciCrunch Literature – provides a searchable index across literature via PubMed, full text articles from the Open Access literature, and other literature archives.\n\nSciCrunch Communities:\nSciCrunch currently supports a diverse collection of communities, each with their own data needs:\n\n* Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) – is a biological search engine that allows students, educators, and researchers to navigate the Big Data landscape by searching the contents of data resources relevant to neuroscience - providing a platform that can be used to pull together information about the nervous system. Underlying the NIF system is the Neurolex knowledge base. Neurolex seeks to define the major concepts of neuroscience, e.g., brain regions, cell types, in a way that is understandable to a machine.\n\n* NIDDK Information Network (dkNET) – serves the needs of basic and clinical investigators by providing seamless access to large pools of data relevant to the mission of The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK). The portal contains information about research resources such as antibodies, vectors and mouse strains, data, protocols, and literature.\n\n* Research Resource Identification Initiative (RII) – aims to promote research resource identification, discovery, and reuse. The RII portal offers a central location for obtaining and exploring Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) - persistent and unique identifiers for referencing a research resource. A critical goal of the RII is the widespread adoption of RRIDs to cite resources in the biomedical literature. RRIDs use established community identifiers where they exist, and are cross-referenced in our system where more than one identifier exists for a single resource.\n\n* Drug Design Data Resource (D3R) – aims to advance the technology of computer-aided drug discovery through the interchange of high quality protein-ligand datasets and workflows, and by holding community-wide, blinded prediction challenges.",

        "text": "Background: Traditionally, neuroimaging studies present significant whole brain voxel wide associations with personality traits or clinical disorders and only those areas are followed-up consequently. The present study aims to investigate a novel methodological approach focusing on the complete anatomical association pattern instead of single significant regions of interest. We aimed at methodological development for: (1) a reliable estimation of whole-brain R2 representing the overall neuroanatomic determination of a trait / disorder; (2) developing indicators for whole-brain neuroanatomical similarity of different traits and estimations of their shared origin in a similar overall neuroanatomy.\nMethods: Using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner we collected whole brain structural T1-weigheted MPRAGE neuroimaging data in typically developing youths as well as adolescents with a disruptive behavior. All youths were behaviorally well characterized using standardized clinical interviews/testing, including callousness and aggression (RPQ: Reactive Proactive Aggression Questionnaire/YPI: Youth Psychopathy Inventory/ICU: Inventory of Callous-Unemotional traits). Neuroimaging data was analyzed using the computational anatomy toolbox. Pre-processing included bias-correction, DARTEL normalization, segmentation, smoothing and quality control. For each subject the mean gray matter volume indices were extracted for every single voxel of the cortex. To date of the preliminary analysis the sample comprised N=182 individuals. Several methods were developed / applied using data simulations, random subsets of the data, using R and related packages.\nResults: Several methods can provide information for aim (1): A whole brain R2 cannot be calculated using ordinary regression due to more voxels than individuals (df<0). R2  can be approximated by (a) collapsing different voxels into bigger units and post-hoc correction for decreased resolution; a chain-wise inclusion of voxel after voxel and calibrating each regression weight with a reference voxel could be another solution to circumvent the problem of N<voxels; (b) using increasingly large random subsamples of voxels asymptotically approximating the R2 for all voxels; (c) Correlating the standardized regression coefficients profile for each voxel in two independent samples (DV=trait). (2) If two different traits are used, method (c) also allows an approximation of shared neuroanatomic origins of two different traits / disorders. Considering preliminary analyses, R2 ranged between 6 and 12% for different traits on the psychopathic spectrum. \nConclusions: Whole-brain neuroanatomic R2 of different traits can be reliably approximated whereas methods (a,b) cannot be easily used in small samples. However, method “c” seems to be highly useful also for smaller sample sizes. Considering the findings on R², results indicate that neuroanatomic differences account for a significant amount of variance in these traits. Combined with functional neuroimaging, the explanatory impact of the brain on personality traits may even be higher. However, also showing that 88-94% of the variance are explained by other variables, the overlap of these traits can only be partly due to a similar overall neuroanatomy. The methods obtained here, have a similar methodological background like genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The high number of voxels (genes) makes estimations technically challenging. Method “c” in this paper which is the most promising to our understanding, is analogous to a technique recently developed in genetics (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015). Implications for neuroscience are to be discussed.\n",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe development of deep learning technology in recent years has accelerated the evolution of various cognitive architectures composed of artificial neural networks (ANNs) [1].  By using massive quantities of data, these technologies can learn the ability to solve various tasks.\nThe ultimate goal of AI research is to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that gains knowledge of various tasks and can flexibly combine this knowledge to solve more complex problems.  However, currently, each AI only possesses specialized problem-solving abilities for specific tasks, and it cannot reach the level of AGI.\nExistent general intelligence is only the brains of organisms now, so it is effective to approach AGI by considering how a brain works. Also, neuroscience is steadily progressing, along with a clarified understanding of the entire brain's mesoscopic network construction (connectome). Therefore, if cognitive architecture can be designed on the model of the brain's mesoscopic network, it would be expected to approach AGI. These cognitive architectures inspired by the brain are often referred to as biologically-inspired cognitive architecture (BiCA) (c.f. http://bicasociety.org/).\nHowever, it is difficult to combine the entire cognitive architecture with the whole brain all at once. For example, if IT technicians attempted this work, it would require a deep and broad understanding of the field of neuroscience. Realistically, this is quite difficult. On the other hand, computational neuroscientists often construct more local neural network models with detailed functions; however, construction of a precise model for the entire brain is too grand.\n\n\n2. BiCAmon (biologically-inspired cognitive architecture monitor)\n\nTo attack this immense problem, we developed the Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architecture Monitor (BiCAmon), a 3D visualization tool that monitors the internal activity status of various cognitive architectures [2] as an activity on the brain network.\nIn the following, we will explain the functions of BiCAmon.\n\nBasic Functions:\n Structure Display Function: BiCAmon displays 3D information about nodes in every area of the brain. The information includes data of their locations, volume, and structures of connections between nodes.\n Exploration Function: The viewpoint can be moved to different locations and directions with intuitive operation.\n Monitoring Function: Dynamically displays the activity status of cognitive architecture’s functional units that have been equipped with particular nodes.\nKeyword Search Function: Nodes can be searched by entering search terms in the toolbox and clicking on the black button. Searching is done by matching the beginning of the search term; multiple searches are handled by the OR search. Also, detailed information of the search results are displayed at the lower left of the screen, and the node included in the results can be narrowed down by clicking on its X buttons in the detail information box.\nHalf-Mode Switch Function: It is possible to hide or display a brain hemisphere by clicking the green button.\n\nThis time, we used the mouse connectome [3] at a mesoscopic level. We utilized the Allen SDK [4] for the information of coordinates of every area in the brain.\nThe cognitive architecture in the diagrams was constructed using Nengo [5], but we also confirmed the connections in BriCA [6] and Brain Simulator [7].\n\nWe considered the ease of using BiCAmon when we developed cognitive architecture in various calculation platforms. Thus, communication between cognitive architecture and BiCAmon uses the socket communication, and the program is related to displaying operates on Web browsers.\nThe composition of BiCAmon is shown in Figure 1. Cognitive architecture is the monitoring target. It is assumed that this will be written according to a platform that a user chooses. The “BiCAmon server” operates in environments that can execute Python. On WebGL support browsers, the “BiCAmon client” script is executed and the drawing performed.\n\n3. AGI development with a BiCAmon\n\nUsing BiCAmon allows cognitive architecture’s activity status visualization and facilitates understanding of that internal state. However, more important is ultimately making BiCA capable of supporting a mesoscopic network construction in the brain through development processes such as those described below.\n\n1． First, create a primitive cognitive architecture that roughly corresponds with the brain (sensory/motor/decision-making), specify functional activity that supports it, and display it on BiCAmon.\n2． Then, enable dispersing processes like the following.\n (1) IT technicians can develop and improve more detailed cognitive architectures by focusing on specific local networks.  This reduces the requirement of neuroscientific expertise for a broad area.  It is also possible that people will come up with new ideas while considering the association with the brain.\n (2) Neuroscientists will be able to hold functional hypotheses about nervous activity by caring about cognitive architectures. The significant hypothesis will be validated through experiments.\n\nWhichever of these two processes is employed, BiCAmon is a useful tool for comparing between operations of cognitive architecture and activities of the nervous system.\n\n4. Related Works\n\nTo date, the following kinds of tools have been developed.\nBrainNet Viewer [8]　can help researchers visualize structural and functional connectivity patterns from different levels of work on MATLAB. However, it cannot dynamically display cognitive architecture activity status.\nBrain X3 [9] is a human brain activity simulator with a display tool that shows brain activity in 3D. However, its goal is not to display the activity state of the relevant cognitive architecture in an accessible manner, and at present it has not been opened to the public (April, 18, 2016).\n\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe idea that neuroscientific expertise can be of use in AI research is not a novel one. For example, there has been research where the activity state of the representative cognitive architecture “ACT-R” [10] supported FMRI experiment results. Yet now, a functional brain map is finally being constructed for the connectome at a mesoscopic level. Such research is also expected to progress.\n\nAgainst such a background, a “BiCAmon” cognitive architecture monitoring tool is introduced.  Using tools like BiCAmon to access the connection information of the connectome surely allows many researchers to accelerate the development of cognitive architecture. Thus, such tools encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations between the fields of neuroscience and AI.\n\nFurthermore, the source is already publically available through Github and can be used for free [11].",

        "text": "We present a web-based neuron morphology viewer that accepts a variety of neuron morphology file formats (Neurolucida DAT/NRX/ASC/XML, SWC) and presents the resulting neuronal tree as an interactive webpage that consists of both a data-hierarchy and a 3D graphical rendering of the neuron. The viewer was created to reconcile commonly used morphology file formats into a single internal representation.\n\nThe Neurolucida DAT format (MicroBrightField, Inc.) is a widely used data format across experimental labs. It is a closed source binary format and exists in several versions. A reverse-engineered file format description is available at http://neuronland.org. Data is stored as a hierarchical tree of linear segments. The SWC format (Cannon et al. 1998) stores all neurite data as a single array in which each element contains coordinates, cylinder radius, a pointer to its parent, and a neurite type index (soma, axon, dendrite, apical dendrite, etc.). In the Neurolucida software the user is free to choose the neurite names (soma or Soma or CellBody, etc.), and this causes confusion. A limitation of the SWC format on the other hand is its cylindrical representation of the cell body. For most graph-theoretic analyses this is irrelevant, and large morphology projects such as http://neuromorpho.org (Ascoli et al. 2007) and BigNeuron (Peng et al. 2015) have adopted SWC as their data-sharing standard. On the other hand, in the BlueBrain project (Markram et al. 2015), which involves reconstruction of neocortical microcircuitry at the synapse level, the Neurolucida format has been the format of choice.\n\nIn its current implementation, the viewer presents neurons as close as possible to the way they are described by their file format. Our aim is to provide tools to repair morphology files that do not fit nomenclature standards. The viewer can be used with files from the user's local file-system, or it can run as part of the Human Brain Project neuroinformatics platform (NIP) and access HBP-curated neuron morphologies directly. The viewer is under active development to cater to various use cases. In the present version, parts of the neuron can be selected or hidden, and the resulting view can be exported as a 2D image in vector graphics (SVG) format to form the basis of a publication figure. Following the morphology file format meeting that is planned to precede Neuroinformatics 2016, the tool will offer an export function to standardized 3D morphology files. The open source javascript code (https://github.com/rbakker/HBP-morphology-viewer) can be used with the node-js scripting language to construct automated format conversions.\n\nThe tool can be accessed as a stand-alone tool: https://neuroinformatics.nl/HBP/morphology-viewer\nor through the HBP collaboratory: https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/47/nav/4835",

        "text": "In this talk (and accompanying demo), we present a new visualisation of the anatomy and spiking activity in a tadpole spinal cord model. Scientific visualisation is an important technique that allows us to better understand large and/or complex datasets (McCormick et al., 1987). Modern visualisation approaches provide a natural way to demonstrate and highlight important details hidden in data, and to illustrate the interactions and interconnections present. Usually the data concerned have complex three (or higher) dimensional structure, but are typically shown as non-interactive two dimensional images or videos. Our approach to presenting the results of our models is based on virtual reality (VR). This provides a new perspective, bringing the viewer/user closer to the data and allowing them to interact with specific elements in order to access contextualised information in an intuitive and exciting way (Bryson, 1996).\n\nThe dataset that we are visualising consists of the axonal trajectories and physiological (spiking) activity of approximately 1,500 neurons from a model of the Xenopus tadpole spinal cord. In order to create the anatomical part of the data, we use a novel “developmental” approach (Borisyuk et al., 2014). For each neuron, properties such as soma position and dendrite extents are chosen randomly according to a distribution that matches experimental measurements for that particular neuron type. Following this, we simulate the growth of each neuron’s axon according to a set of equations that mimic the response of axon growth cones to chemical gradients. The sensitivities to chemical gradients were chosen using an optimization routine, such that the statistics of the generated axons match those of stained real axons. When the axon of one neuron crosses the dendritic area of another neuron, a synapse is created between the two with some probability. By mapping approximately 80,000 synapses that this process generates onto a network of single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley neurons (with parameters chosen to fit available electrophysiological data (Sautois et al., 2007)), we are able to simulate the spiking activity in the entire spinal cord. This model can produce various physiological behaviours, such as robust swimming in response to sensory input (Roberts et al., 2014) and transient synchronous activity (Li et al., 2014). Our visualisation maintains the integrity of the original data while providing a novel approach to studying them.\n\nThe demonstration consists of two sections: the first is used to provide context and scale, and the second actually visualises the axonal and spiking data. The first section shows the typical swimming behaviour of a tadpole in a natural environment (a rockpool within a lush forest). An important element in VR is the sense of scale (Steuer, 1992) and we take advantage of this in the first section by shrinking the user to a fifth of the size of an average human. This gives the user a different perspective, allowing them to better relate to the tadpole and its size within the environment. The second section takes place inside a “virtual lab” where the user’s scale is reduced even further, to allow them to relate and understand the neurobiological data. The spinal cord is dynamically constructed around the user in order to display the contextualised information in an immersive way (Figure 1). The user is able to play back the results of the physiological simulation, showing how the different neurons interact with each other to produce swimming behaviour. The rendered environment is fully interactive and provides information within context for the user, including labels showing neuron types, their axonal connections, and spiking activity.\n\nWe chose to develop the software with a dedicated game engine (Unity Game Engine, 2016) because of its platform versatility and VR support, although other similar engines are available (see e.g. Unreal Game Engine, 2016). A number of innovative techniques were used, from photogrammetry (Baltsavias, 1999) for building the natural environment, to developing a custom chunking system for optimised rendering (Ebert et al., 2000), which is required due to the size and complexity of the data. At runtime the axonal data are converted into meshes that are optimised for rendering without compromising the integrity of the raw data. All the metadata sits in separate memory structures to the rendering data, allowing for the future possibility of implementing a more dynamic system with adaptable mesh generation and a separate representation of connections between different data chunks.\n\nWe believe that this visualisation approach is general and suitable for many applications beyond our model of the tadpole spinal cord. It could easily be adapted to visualise similar spiking neuron models, either using existing information about the spatial structure of the network or algorithmic techniques to select the clearest possible arrangement of cells. Alternatively, it could also be used to visualise the anatomy of real neural circuits, using anatomical data from experiments. We see significant value in broader application of this visualisation approach both within the neuroscience community and more generally, to provide new tools designed for complex data analysis in virtual reality.",

        "text": "Epilepsy is a common brain disorder which affects nearly 65 million people in the world. Electroencephalography is the most important technique for the diagnosis of epilepsy till date. The ictal signatures present in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are usually detected by visual examination by the neuro-clinician or neuro-physiologist. This is an extremely tedious and error prone work since, the EEG signals are contaminated with various artifacts. Further, locating the epicenter of seizures is even more challenging due to the non-stationary nature of EEG. Hence, application of expert models for detection and source localization of ictal signatures is extremely important. In this work, we have proposed a novel methodology for detecting ictal signatures in EEG using complex wavelet transform and fuzzy-Sugeno classifier. The minimum reduction and maximum relevance technique was applied for feature selection. The results showed ceiling level of accuracy and coherent statistical performances. The classified ictal periods were used for the performing independent component analysis and subsequently cortical source localization over the Montreal Neurological Institute head model. The outcomes stamp successful seizure detection and visualization of the ictal events over the human cortex. This development assists in fast and accurate diagnosis of epilepsy and can be of utmost use in developing and under-developed countries where the patients to neurologists’ ratio is phenomenally higher. Additionally, the cortical location of the epileptic seizures helps in predicting the progression of pharmacological treatment and possible surgical outcomes.",

        "text": "Focal seizures typically begin with an electrographic onset pattern that is highly stereotyped in individual patients. Qualitative classifications of these onset patterns describe two frequently occurring waveforms – low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high amplitude spikes (HAS). Interestingly, only the former of the patterns is associated with a good surgical outcome. Given the importance of this clinical distinction, we therefore explored whether these two patterns arise from fundamentally different spatio-temporal dynamics.\n\nWe used a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, and validated it as an adequate model using clinical recordings of focal seizures. Using this model we then investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns.\n\nWe show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the spatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time (see Fig. 1A). In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event (see Fig. 1B). We find that such a global transition is enabled by an increase in excitability of the surrounding tissue, essentially creating a seizure supporting surrounding. In our simulations, the difference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation of the clinically observed difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate how changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated in principle using active stimulation.\nWe conclude that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core plays a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well as in the surgical outcome.",

        "text": "1 Background and motivation Intracranial pressure (ICP) after severe brain injuries or similar life threatening conditions can be continuously monitored [1]. The ICP signal contains useful information to predict life threatening conditions such as intracranial hypertension. So far, monitoring approaches are focusing mainly on the relationship between arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Own observation in pediatric patients however, showed that changes in heart rate have direct influence on the ICP.Our hypothesis therefore is that the HR-ICP relationship can be quantified via complex event processing methods. A few works concentrate on the capability of identifying a model describing the intracranial system behaviour. For example in [2] the authors present an estimation algorithm based on hidden state estimation approach and non linear Kalman filters to estimate unobserved variable given some measurements such as ICP and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). What might be interesting is understanding the interelationship between ICP and other measures of the monitored patients. For example in [3] the authors present ApEN an algorithm based on the adaptive calculation of approximate entropy, integrated with a causal coherence analysis that is able to exploit the potential interaction between ICP and R wave intervals [3]. Interesting in this sense is also [4] where the authors extract indeces from beat to beat mean intracranial pressure measurements and intervals between consecutive normal sinus heart beats (ICP and RR intervals). Starting from the visual observation that heart rate and ICP present peaks at similar points, we applied several statistical methodologies to identify such co-occurences of peaks and the relationships existing between the two time series. Moreover we are currently investigating the relationship existing also with the other variables monitored. This preliminary analysis performed appear to be promising and we are now extending our work to perform online peaks detection of ICP peaks considering the relationship between the ICP and HR. 2 Data: ICP and additional variables monitored The dataset we are working on is composed by 38 pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. For all of the patients, we have the following parameters:abp mean arterial pressure (mmHg),HR heart (rate /min), ICP inracranial pressure (mmHg), AMP intracranial pulse pressure amplitudes ,HRVLFHF heart rate variability (ratio lowfrequency power / high frequency power, HRhfRel percentage of high frequency power ,CPP cerebral perfusion pressure (mmHg). The time series are sampled at a rate of 1.2E-05/second 3 Methods and findings To test and evaluate our initial hypothesis regarding the relationships existing between heart rate pressure and intracranial pressure, we performed a wide range of different statistical analysis. As shown in figure 1 the two series of HR and ICP show a similar behaviour in the peaks patterns. 1 Figure 1: ICP and HR cross talk event detection To further investigate the similar behaviours we firstly performed an analysis in terms of recurrence plots (RP). RP is a statistical analysis technique used for nonlinear data. The data are visualized through a graph in a square matrix (column and rows represents a pair of times), where the elements are representation of the times at which a state of the dynamical system recurred [5]. Mathematically RP represents the time stamps in which the phase space trajectory of the system that we are considering, passes through the same area in the phase space [5] [6]. Figure 2: ICP recurrence plots with embedding dimension 2 The recurrence quantification analysis is a method that quantifies the number and duration of recurrences of a dynamical system presented by its state in the phase space trajectory. Some of these measures include the Recurrence Rate (RR), Determinism (DET), Laminarity (LAM), Ratio (RATIO), Traping Time (TT), Divergence (DIV), Entropy (ENTR), and Trend (TREND). A further description about these measures can be found in [5]. The first visualisation and analysis of the recurrence plots (see figure 2) indicate that there is an existent time pattern, the determinism of the system is significant. Therefore, it is possible to find a model that successfully predicts the behaviour of the series, and can be integrated with other variables such as the Heart Rate. This method can also be further extended by using integrative measurements. Similar to the diagonal-wise defined recurrence rate, the other measures based on the diagonal lines (DET, L, ENTR) can be defined diagonal-wise. These definitions are useful to study interrelations or synchronisation between different systems (using recurrence plots or cross recurrence plots), for instance the first application could be integrating ICP and HR recurrence or cross recurrence plots. An additional analysis we performed was the one considering the cross correlation function. Cross correlation represents the similarity between two signals, as a function of the shift or temporal translation applied to one of the two signals [7] 2 [8]. We performed the cross correlation function between the two time series ICP and HR to further analyse the values of the correlation between them. As we can see from figure 3 there is a correlation between the two time series, therefore this additional exploratory statistical analysis further suggest our initial intuition of a possible relationship between the two signals. 3.1 Wavelets analysis and wavelet coherence A further analysis we performed for understanding the relationship between two time series is the Wavelet Coherence, that is a method able to determine and to visualize areas with high common power (i.e. high common correlation) between two time series [9]. Before performing such test, we checked for the normality of the two time series considering the Shapiro Wilcox Test for normality. Since the test showed normality in the data proposed, we performed the Wavelet Coherence between the two time series, as we can see from figure 3 The resulting plot shows particularly interesting characteristics. In fact it identifies regions (in red) where the two signals are highly correlated and it also tells us in which time instants such correlation happens. This is particularly useful for our analysis, considering the fact that we are looking for correlation in particular time instances (i.e. when peaks occur). Therefore such time instances could be revealed by the Wavelet Coherence graphs. Moreover we performed two additional analysis with wavelets, involving the wavelets correlations and the wavelet clustering. In the first case, the wavelet correlation showed a high correlation between the ICP and HR as we can see from figure 3. In the case of clustering, so far we have analysed the wavelet power clustering considering three time series HR, ICP and HRVLFHF. As we can see from the figure 3 the ICP and HR are clustered together (1 and 2 in the tree) and further from the time series of HRVLFHF supporting even more our hypothesis about similarity between HR and ICP behaviours.

In this way we could try to find correlations between peaks happening in the ICP and in the HR series, seeing the possible temporal correlation between them. This is the first step for a further implementation of peaks prediction algorithm that will be the next step in our study. In the figure 4 we can see the result of the peaks detection algorithm in the ICP series. (a) (b) Figure 4: Example of the application of the peaks algorithm detection we implemented to the ICP time series and to the HR time series. We performed preliminary analysis on peaks detection in HR and ICP and we obtained a significant overlap in the peaks detected in the ICP and HR, suggesting the validation of our initial intuition regarding the possibility of crosstalks events between ICP and HR as well as the possibility for a future utilization of HR information to predict ICP peaks and trends. 4.1 Granger Causality Test A further statistical analysis we are currently performing is the Granger Causality test. Such test [11] check whether it is possible to infer a cause effect reltionship given two time serieses considering the concept of Ganger Causality [12]. We performed preliminary granger test causality on the HR and ICP time series, and first preliminary results on some samples show a significant p-value (0.012) of an existing causal relationship between HR and ICP. Such approach has been widely used also in brain data processing, for references see [13] [14] [15]. 5 Results and Conclusions The preliminary analysis performed on a subset of 3 patients from the cohort of 38 patients, suggests that our initial visual intuation is confirmed from a preliminary statistical analysis of the dataset. The Wavelet Coherence, as well as the peaks detection algorithm and the recurrence plots, confirmed our preliminary hypothesis. We are now further analysing the time series using the Granger Causality method, trying to understand the causality correlations existing between the various time series as well as further develop our methodology to implement an online ICP peaks detection algorithm.",

We compare data from 22 patients with left TLE and 39 control subjects.\nResults: We find that patients have significant alterations in region size but only subtle changes in white matter connectivity. When region size and white matter connectivity are combined this leads to significant alterations in connectivity strength.\nConclusion: Connectomics is frequently used to compare brain networks, however our results suggest caution should be used when interpreting the results where there are known alterations in regional properties. Our work unifies results from regional and connectomic literature.",

        "text": "Our work on connectomics over the last 15 years has shown a small-world, modular, and hub architecture of brain networks (Martin et al. 2001; Sporns et al. 2004). Small-world features enable the brain to rapidly integrate and bind information while the modular architecture, present at different hierarchical levels, allows separate processing of various kinds of information (e.g. visual or auditory) while preventing a wide-scale spreading of activation (Kaiser et al. 2007a). Hub nodes play critical roles in information processing and are involved in many brain diseases (Kaiser et al. 2007b).\n\nNonetheless, general observations of human brain connectivity, or of patients at the group-level, have so far had little impact on understanding cognition, or deficiencies in cognition, in individual subjects. As a result, human connectome information is not used as a biomarker for diagnosis or a predictor of the most suitable treatment strategy. After discussing the organisation of brain networks, we will show how connectivity can be used to determine treatment in individual patients. An important aspect of brain networks is their spatial and topological organisation (Kaiser et al. 2006). However, simply observing connectivity is insufficient as small changes in network organisation might lead to large changes in network behaviour (dynamics) (Kaiser, 2013). We therefore show how simulations can be applied to predict regions that are involved in pathological processes. For epilepsy, simulations show us which regions are involved (Hutchings et al. 2015), which treatment approach should be used, and whether a surgical intervention will be successful or not (Sinha et al. 2016).\n\nThese are first steps towards using connectome-based computer simulations as a tool to understand normal and pathological processing in individuals and to model effects and side effects. While intervention for epilepsy involved surgical removal of parts of the brain, other diseases can be treated non-invasively through neuro-feedback or brain stimulation techniques. Developing models that are based on anatomical and functional information will be crucial for precision medicine of neural disorders (Wang et al. 2015).",

        "text": "Everyday life involves decision making situations of various kinds. Decision making research so far has been investigated separately in the domains of perceptual, value-based, and social domains. One view is that we represent various alternatives through their subjective values. Accordingly, the neural substrates of decision making would involve a common circuit across different domains of decision making. One Challenge in verifying this hypothesis is that different paradigms are used for different domains of decision making and therefore cannot be studied in single studies. We use Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of published fMRI studies to identify brain activations corresponding to perceptual, value-based, and social decision making. We used the database from http://Neurosynth.org to identify a subset of 508 studies from a total of that contained at least one of the six keywords – reward, decision, choice, value, social, and percept in their title or abstract that was extracted from PubMed. Of these studies, we used a minimum of one occurrence of the first three keywords in title or abstract as further inclusion criteria. Finally, we identified 36, 84, and 61 studies for perceptual, valued based and social decision making, respectively. Peak activations for these studies were subjected to three separate ALE meta analyses using GingerALE software and thresholded at p < 0.001 with an extent of 200 mm^3. Automated anatomical labelling available from WFUpickatlas was used for estimating all combinations of the overlap of the three ALE activation maps. We found that the common neural activation across all three domains of decision making was primarily in basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, pallidum) and insula. The common activations in these four regions of the brain were observed bilaterally (Left – 26%, 39%, 62%, 21%, Right – 24%, 30%, 37%, 11%, respectively, of the region activated). These four regions also had a high overlap of activation for value-based and social decision making (i.e. excluding perceptual decision making) observed bilaterally (Left – 40%, 30%, 23%, 16%, Right – 57%, 30%, 36%, 13%, respectively). Other regions that were commonly activated by only value and social decision making were Amygdala (L - 26%, R – 5%; R - 21% was active for social decision making alone), Anterior Cingulate (L – 79%, R – 57%), Thalamus (L – 23%, R - 12%), Angular gyrus (L – 11%), olfactory area (L - 19%, R - 35%), medial orbitofrontal cortex (L - 13%, R - 10%), and superior medial frontal gyrus (12%). Certain proportions of several of these regions were activated by value-based decision making alone. Of further interest was the exclusive activations to value-based decision making in mid and posterior cingulate (19%, 57%), frontal inferior triangulated area (L - 17%), and gyrus rectus (L – 13%, R – 10%). Exclusive activations to perceptual decision making were found in frontal inferior opericulum (L – 20%), Inferior parietal area (L – 20%, R – 11%), precentral gyrus (L – 13%), and supplementary motor area (14%), possibly reflecting task-related activity. In sum, our findings support a common neural circuit across different domains of decision making, and also point to brain areas that could be operating differently depending on the type of decision making task.",

        "text": "Computational dynamical models describing intracellular signaling pathways of nerve cells are increasing in size and complexity as more information is obtained from experiments. Models describing protein interactions within neurons can contain over hundred protein reactions [1, 2]. These models are built from knowledge about the interaction topology, inferred from e.g. gene knock-out experiments, as well as from experimental quantitative data describing the input-output relationship of the observed system. The quantitative data are often sparse as compared to the size of the system, and translating the experimental information into dynamical models often results in large uncertainties in the parameter (e.g reaction rates) values. This uncertainty is partly due to the sparseness in experimental time series data (practical unidentifiability), but it is also an intrinsic feature of the modeled system (structural unidentifiability) and could reflect the possibility for biological variation [3]; in many biological systems the same function can be achieved in partly different ways due to degeneracy and redundancy. Here we investigate the extent of this parameter uncertainty, in a model describing calcium (Ca)-dependent activation of Calmodulin (CaM), Protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) and Ca/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) [4], which is an intracellular pathway of importance to synaptic plasticity.\n\nWe presume that the structure of the model is correct and then characterize the uncertainty in the parameters based on data. This is done by sampling the subspace of parameter values which has an equally good fit to data (corresponding to the “viable space” in [5]), through a statistical approach known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [6]. ABC has been proposed for parameter estimation in system biology models previously, albeit in slightly different settings, e.g. [7, 8], and can be applied to a wide range of problems. In order to characterize the viable space efficiently with several experimental datasets, we employ multivariate probability distributions called copulas as a part of the ABC sampling. The result is a multivariate posterior distribution for the parameters, which represents how much they are constrained by the data (i.e. the uncertainty) as illustrated in Figure 1 (pairwise plots of viable space for four parameters indicating constraints and dependencies before and after calibration to data). The next step is to look into how the parameter uncertainty is translated to uncertainty of the predictions made from the model.\n\nWe also investigate the role and importance of different parameters, with respect to different model outputs including the predictions, by means of global sensitivity analysis [9]. Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of one of the outputs calculated by a method based on the decomposition of the variance [10, 11, 12], showing different types of sensitivity measures. Finally, we explore how the sensitivity of different subsets of parameters change as different parts of the viable space are investigated, which is shown in Figure 3, where sensitivity profiles are clustered into groups with different sensitivity characteristics.",

        "text": "General purpose computing with graphics processing units (GPUs) has come a long way since the first pioneers used graphics oriented shader languages to implement their first proof of concept studies. However, even though the CUDA [1] and OpenCL [2] application programming interfaces (APIs) today largely facilitate the use of GPUs for general purpose computing and abstract away much of the complexities of the massively parallel GPU architectures, writing efficient code for GPU accelerators remains a challenge. Many different aspects need to be considered, including the overall strategy of how to parallelize a given computational problem, how and what to communicate between GPU and host and how to use the different memory spaces available to the programmer. This is acerbated by a rapid stream of novel features that improve GPU operation but explode the number of choices, programmers need to make.\n\nWith the GPU enhanced neuronal networks (GeNN) framework [3, 4, 5] we have provided a middleware that uses heuristics specific to the application domain of spiking neuronal networks to facilitate the work of the scientific programmer. More specficially, in GeNN users define a neuronal network model by providing the following ingredients in a simple C++ API:\n- Descriptions of neurons models, including code strings for updating the neuron state and detecting spikes;\n- Descriptions of synapse models including update rules for pre-synaptic spikes, pre-synaptic spike “events”, definitions for these spike “events”, and potentially learning rules\n- Post-synaptic models that describe how pre-synaptic activation is translated into a post-synaptic current\n- A definition of neuron populations, based on any of the described neuron types\n- A definition of synapse populations, complete with the source and target populations of neurons, synaptic model and post-synaptic model\nBased on this description, GeNN then creates optimised code to run the model on any NVIDIA CUDA enabled hardware accelerators it detects. If several accelerators are present, GeNN will detect the most appropriate one and use it. When generating the code, GeNN will take care of both, the more strategic decisions, such as deciding which device to use, how to choose block sizes, and how to efficiently communicate spike and spike events, and the details of “bean counting” where the sizes of neuron populations don’t match the best block size, and indices need to be tracked for more efficient sparse matrix methods. This frees the computational scientist to focus on the scientific investigation.\nGeNN is, however, designed for maximal flexibility and transparency for expert users. Using a code generation approach and only providing the critical code for GPU-accelerator and data management related functions, the user is in full control of the remainder of the code. Therefore, GeNN can easily be used in many different scenarios, ranging from large scale simulations on GPU accelerated High Perfomance Computers to embedded controllers used in robotics.\n\nFor users who are not keen on full programmatic control of the user-side code we have devised higher-level interfaces in the form of Spinecreator/SpineML [6,7] integration and the brian2genn interface [7,8]. In the former, users can use the SpineCreator graphical interface to design models and can then execute them on a GPU accelerator through an interface to GeNN. In the latter, users can define their models fully in the Brian 2 simulator and can then choose the “genn” device to run the model on a GPU accelerator through GeNN.\n\nGeNN can for some models achieve speed-ups of more than 100 fold over the speed of a single CPU core [4], but for other models, simple CPU simulation may be faster. When used through brian2genn, the benchmarks are similar, with a wide spread of performances depending on the model. While the devil is in the detail, generally models with sparse activity, sparse, but ordered, connections and a heavy computational load for the neuron dynamics, e.g. in Hodgkin-Huxley models, are fastest. Models with dense random connections and many spikes typically benefit less from the GPU acceleration with GeNN.\n\nThe GeNN team is now developing methods for distributing computations on several GPUs simultaneously and the support of OpenCL is being initiated in the framework of a Google Summer of Code project.\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the GeNN workflow.",

        "text": "Neuroimaging studies increasingly use multiple acquisitions (i.e., MEG, fMRI, DWI, T1, T2, MTI) to provide an integrative view of the human brain. These rich data often requires integration of diverse methods from specialist laboratories (e.g., SPM for fMRI, FSL for DWI, FreeSurfer for cortical thickness), which can be difficult and hard to document. Additionally, the large and complex workflow is not only more prone to human error, but errors are harder to detect.\nAutomatic analysis (aa) is an open-source, high-level framework written in MATLAB, that provides an efficient solution for workflow integration. It is beneficial even for simple, single subject studies, but especially useful for large, multimodal studies. It relies on pipelines described by XML tasklists and run with a short user script. Together, these provide an accurate, easy-to-read, distributable summary of the methods, allow re-creation of the whole analysis, and serve as Supplementary Material for publication, facilitating transparency. Flexibility and workflow integration is strongly supported by stream renaming, pipeline branching and connection.\nApart from integrating and providing easy to employ access to already existing tools such as those of SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, ANT, GLMdenoise and Motion Fingerprint and many more; aa also includes novel developments. For instance, nonlinear fitting of the diffusion tensor for DTI, as well as fitting for diffusion kurtosis imaging. A framework for MEG data analysis has been also implemented with a set of modules covering most of the preprocessing and certain steps of the analysis.\naa also integrates various diagnostics, as well as visualisation of the data and results. Low-level diagnostics are complemented with diagnostics at various stage of the analysis, which help detect errors and facilitates a better understanding of the results. Both vertical (within-subject) and horizontal (across subjects) summaries with descriptive statistics where applicable are provided. Horizontal summaries help to identify subjects outlying due to either technical or human error, whereas vertical summaries of the given subjects help to localize the erroneous stage; all without requiring browsing for tens or hundreds of folders in various locations.\"\n",

Too often, this comparison is done in an ad-hoc manner in the discussion section of journal articles describing computational models. We present the Brain Operation DataBase (BODB, http://bodb.usc.edu), a neuroinformatics resource that fills this gap by documenting models of the brain in terms of their computational principles and their relation to the experimental data used to build and test them (Arbib et al., 2014; Bonaiuto & Arbib, 2016). Model descriptions are linked via summaries of simulation results (SSRs) to summaries of experimental data (SEDs) used to build the model and inform its design. Moreover, a model may be analyzed both in terms of the brain structures it represents and the Brain Operating Principles (BOPs) it exemplifies. The SEDs are cast at a level of description relevant to the model, with links to lower-level descriptions of the data in federated databases where available. We demonstrate the federation between BODB and SensoriMotorDB, a database we have developed that is dedicated to storing and organizing data from neurophysiological experiments in the sensorimotor system. BODB allows users to define custom high-level analyses that can be run on data in SensoriMotorDB, the results of which can be imported into BODB as summaries of experimental data and linked to model descriptions. Model simulation results are then linked and compared to summaries of experimental data used to test the model, or classified as predictions where such data does not yet exist. These links allow semi-automated comparison of different models via BODB’s model benchmarking tool. BODB allows model development to proceed cumulatively, as models build upon the strengths and/or weaknesses of previous modeling efforts to address a wider range of data.",

        "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe human brain has roughly one hundred billion neurons forming a network with trillions of intra-connections. The mapping of structure and functionality of brain networks is therefore an important challenge in understanding the functioning. Connectivity matrices are used to represent brain networks, also called  connectome [1,2], as a graph [3–5], where nodes correspond to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections [6–8].\nDifferent measures have been applied to describe topological features of brain networks [9–11]. For instance, the independence of large areas, denoted as integration, has been studied by the path length measure, the characteristic path length [12], or the global efficiency [13]. Independence of small subsets, defined as segregation, can be analyzed by the clustering coefficient [12], the transitivity [14] or the modularity [15]. The importance of individual nodes can be defined with centrality measures such as the  degree [16]. A good summary of the measures can be found in [10].\nIn this work, we present a global and two local measures, based on the mutual information measure, to quantify brain networks structure.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHOD\nA. Materials\nSynthetic model networks were created using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) [10].  Random, lattice, ring lattice and small-world model networks with 128 and 256 nodes with edges ranging from 128 to 8192 with a step of 128 edges were used. Additionally, networks with nodes ranging from 32 to 512 with a step of 32 and a density of 0.4 were also created.\nAs human structural networks, we used the normalized connection matrices created from MRI tractography described in [17]. As human functional networks, we used the HCP 500-PTN functional dataset [18–20].\nAll networks were weighted and non-directed.\nB. Method\nIn the proposed approach, brain networks are modelled as a Markov process where neuronal impulses randomly walk from one node to another node. This new interpretation provides a solid theoretical framework from which we derive a global (i.e., a single value for the whole network) and two local (i.e., a value for each node) measures based on mutual information.\nMutual information (MI) measures the shared information between two random variables. From our Markov process-based brain model, we propose as a global connectivity measure the mutual information between two consecutive states of the process. Mutual information can also be seen as the difference between the uncertainty of the states without any knowledge and the uncertainty of the states when the past is known (or information gained when the previous node is known). The higher the MI, the less random the connections. Thus, mutual information can be used to quantify the overall brain structure.\nThe mutual information can be decomposed in order to characterize the degree of informativeness of each state. When applied to the connectome, since each state corresponds to an anatomical or functional region, this measure can be seen as the contribution of each node to the whole graph structure. In this work, we propose two local measures. On the one hand, we use the mutual surprise (I1) [21], that expresses how ‘surprising’ are the connections of a node. Nodes that are connected with more likely nodes will lead to low values of mutual surprise, while those with very specific connections or connected with few unlikely nodes will have high mutual surprise. On the other hand, we use the mutual predictability (I2) [21], that expresses the uncertainty of a node taking into account the mean connectivity of all the network. I2 measures the capacity of prediction for a given brain region.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nUsing model networks with different number of edges, an optimum point was found for lattice and ring lattice networks when increasing the density. This is due to the fact that for low densities, there are regions not connected, thus, the overall mutual information is low. This fact may help to find a minimum number of fibers needed to study brain networks for a given brain parcellation. Overall, higher values were obtained for lattice and ring lattice models, showing a clear evidence of more organized networks compared to random and small-world networks. When the number of edges was increased, the mutual information tended to decrease, since the higher number of connections, the lower correlation between consecutive states.\nPreserving the density, the mutual information was not very sensitive to random and small-world networks, since the structure is similar. Higher values were obtained for ring lattice networks when comparing with lattice networks, since in lattice networks two nodes are not connected and have a less structured network. Using anatomical and functional connectomes at different scales, a similar behavior was observed for all patients.\nLocal measures were evaluated using the human connectomes. The mutual surprise highlighted regions connected to regions not highly connected, such as the right hemisphere transverse temporal. Low values were obtained for regions connected to highly connected regions such as the left hemisphere thalamus proper. The mutual predictability associated regions with a low number of connections and high weights with a high predictability, such us the right hemisphere temporal pole. Low values were obtained in regions with more uncertainly in predicting the next node, such as the right hemisphere putamen.\nAll measures were consistent for structural and functional human networks.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, new measures to quantify structure of complex brain networks are proposed. Brain connectivity graphs are interpreted as a stochastic process where neural impulses are modeled as a random walk. This interpretation provides a solid theoretical framework from which different measures based on the mutual information measure have been applied.\nThe measures have been tested on synthetic model networks and structural and functional human networks at different scales. Results show that the mutual information is able to quantify the structure of different model networks. The mutual surprise, allows the identification of nodes whose neighbors have a high connectivity taking into account all connections. The mutual predictability, shows that regions with a high clustering tend to be more predictable.",

        "text": "The nerve fibre projections that connect different areas of the cortical sheet constitute a complex structural network for neural communication in the brain. How is the organization of this cortical connectome related to other features of brain architecture?  We addressed the question by systematically investigating the relation of structural parameters of cortical areas, such as their distance, similarity in cortical cytoarchitecture as described by cortical lamination or neuronal density, as well as similarity of cortical thickness, to essential features of long-range cortico-cortical connections, such as their presence or absence as well as patterns of laminar projection origins and terminations.\n\nAcross different species (primate, cat, mouse) and different cortical lobes, the essential features of cortico-cortical connections varied consistently and strongly with the cytoarchitectonic similarity of cortical areas. By contrast, such relations were not found consistently for distance or similarity of cortical thickness. As gradients in cortical cytoarchitecture also determine the specific organisation of the local micro-circuits of different areas, our findings illuminate general principles of neural wiring, linking the organization of long-range connections to intrinsic circuits of the cerebral cortex.",

        "text": "Past few decades have seen tremendous growth in computational neuroscience. This is reflected in the scientific literature with the emergence of new journals devoted to theoretical and computational neuroscience (e.g. Neural Computation, Journal of Computational Neuroscience) as well as from the publication of modeling papers in the general neuroscience research literature. Similarly prominence of computational modeling in neuroscience is evident from proposals submitted to, and funded by, NSF, NIH and other organizations in the US and in various other countries in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Proposals submitted by experimentalists contain significant computational research component. During the same time powerful simulation environments such as NEURON [1], NEST [2], Brian [3], PyNN [4], MOOSE [5], GENESIS [6] have evolved along with model sharing and informatics tools such as ModelDB [7], Open Source Brain (OSB) [8], OpenWorm [9], Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) [10], and NeuroML [11]. The simulation environments have been developed to allow simulation of large parallel neuronal models on high performance computing (HPC) resources. Imaging community is processing larger amount of data coming out of MRI, fMRI, EEG imaging techniques and are in need of HPC for processing. As is well known the past decade or so has seen tremendous growth in cyberinfrastructure (CI), including HPC, data resources, fast networks, software and workflows.\n\nAll of these hold the promise for the broader computational neuroscience community to utilize HPC for research which involves complex models (especially large scale networks) or complex protocols (often involving learning rules), or require high-dimensional optimization or parameter space exploration or processing of large amount of imaging data. Such projects have a tremendous potential to use CI, but the broader computational neuroscience community do not have easy access to HPC and in many cases are forced to keep their research “small” such that it can be accommodated within local desktop or departmental computational resources.\n\nAlthough HPC resources are available at national supercomputer centers in many countries, neuroscience researchers’ access to HPC resources is inhibited by common administrative and technical barriers which include: (i) a process for requesting time on HPC resources every year and that is daunting to most beginners, (ii) difficulty understanding the HPC architecture and complex OS/software environment to optimally install applications on various HPC resources, (iii) having to learn policies and batch system details which are different on each HPC cluster, (iv) challenge of managing workflow that involves multiple remote authentication systems, and (v) figuring out data transfer, output result retrieval and storage issues.\n\nThe solution to this problem is building a community infrastructure layer, called a science gateway [12], that abstracts away the need for dealing with the details of underlying hardware and allows neuroscience researchers easy access to best-of-breed neuroscience simulation and analysis packages running on very large HPC resources.\n\nIn 2012 the US NSF funded the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) project [13, 14] which enables individual computational neuroscientists to utilize free supercomputer time on NSF’s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [15] HPC resources. All of the administrative and technical barriers, that otherwise make it difficult for neuroscientists to use HPC resources for computational modeling, are managed by the NSG team. The NSG has been in operation since early 2013 and has over 300 users. As far as we know this is the first and only such open science gateway available to the neuroscience community within US and abroad and which is providing free access to HPC resources for anyone from anywhere in the world. About 60% of the NSG users are from US and the rest are from Europe, Asia and elsewhere.\n\nSince NSG went into production in 2013, NSG users used about 187,000 supercomputer core hour units (SUs) in 2013, about 600,000 SUs in 2014, about 1,844,000 SUs in 2015 and for the current 2016 year we have acquired about 3,700,000 SUs. SUs are acquired every year by submitting an allocation proposal (written by the NSG team on behalf of the NSG user community) to the national XSEDE supercomputer review committee and the proposals are peer reviewed. We have been very successful in acquiring SUs although it is a very competitive peer reviewed process. Number of NSG users have grown steadily – in 2013 we had about 100 users, in 2014 about 200 users, in 2015 about 270 users and by April, 2016 we have about 325 users. Over the last 3.5 years, the average NSG job uses about 200 - 300 cores and larger jobs have used 4096 cores. Close to 10,000 jobs have been run during the past 3.5 years by NSG users.\n\nIn 2015 NSF and the BBSRC in UK jointly awarded a follow-on international collaborative grant as a part of which RESTful services will be implemented for the NSG. This will allow researchers to programmatically access HPC resources, for complex computational modeling, both from the familiar environment of neuroscience community projects (such as the OSB, ModelDB, OpenWorm, NIF) and from the familiar work environment as it exists within the laptop or desktop of individual users. Integration with community projects will significantly increase the impact of NSG for the neuroscience community.\n\nAll of these demonstrate that the NSG is filling a vacuum that existed for computational neuroscience researchers eager to engage in large scale neuronal simulations and processing of imaging data. This is underscored by the enthusiastic feedback we have received from NSG users. This is also very timely in this context the two large scale, decade long projects that were initiated in 2013 to revolutionize the understanding of the human brain - the BRAIN Initiative [16] in the US and the Human Brain Project [17] in the EU. Developing brain models, running large scale neuronal simulations on supercomputers, analyzing large data sets, and creating new simulation and neuroinformatics tools are central components of both of those initiatives. NSG is already well poised to be a key resource for the new, computationally intensive research that these projects will spawn.",

        "text": "The Blue Brain Project has established a unifying data-driven process for the digital reconstruction of a prototypical neocortical microcircuit. The process unifies a vast body of anatomical and physiological data on ion channel kinetics and distributions, neuron morphologies and electrical types, synaptic kinetics and dynamics to yield an in silico reconstruction of the cellular and synaptic organization of juvenile rat somatosensory cortex. In this talk, I will present a draft anatomical and physiological map of a prototypical neocortical microcircuit. The map represents the first comprehensive integration of available data and knowledge in a quantitative in silico reconstruction of a part of the brain. To achieve this, a novel predictive strategy was developed using sparse data on the cellular and synaptic organization of the somatosensory cortex of a two-week old rat. The microcircuit is 0.29 mm3 in volume and contains about 31,000 neurons belonging to 55 morphological neuron types and 207 morpho-electrical sub-types distributed across 6 layers. The resulting reconstruction is broadly consistent with current knowledge about the neocortical microcircuit and provides an array of predictions on its structure and function across neuronal, synaptic, and circuit levels. The models in the reconstruction are available as a public resource for collaborative and iterative refinement, and in silico neuroscience.",

        "text": "Recent progress in diffusion MRI and tractography algorithms as well as the launch of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) have provided brain research with an abundance of structural connectivity data.\n\nA major challenge in this research effort is that the inferred brain networks, as well as their topological properties, are often sensitive to the parameters of the tractography process. In probabilistic tractography, the most critical of those parameters is the connectivity threshold τ that determines whether the tractography-generated streamlines from a given seed voxel to a target ROI occur with sufficiently large probability to indicate the presence of an actual connection.\n\nThis work focuses on the following problem: how to infer the structural network between a given set of grey matter ROIs in a reliable way that does not require an arbitrary choice of the connectivity threshold? The proposed method, referred to as Minimum Asymmetry Network Inference Algorithm (MANIA), exploits a fundamental limitation of diffusion MRI imaging and of the tractography process: diffusion MRI can estimate the orientation of fibers in each voxel but it cannot infer the polarity (afferent versus efferent) of those fibers. Similarly, a tractography algorithm can combine those per-voxel orientations to “stitch together” expected connections but it does not provide any information about the direction of those connections.\n\nGiven this limitation, MANIA expects that the presence of an actual connection from voxel X to voxel Y (in that direction) will be detected by the tractography process as a symmetric connection between X and Y. Similarly, if there is no connection between X and Y, the tractography process should not detect a connection in either direction. Based on this principle, MANIA formulates the network inference problem as an optimization over the range of connectivity threshold values: it selects the value of τ that minimizes the asymmetry of the resulting network. The network asymmetry is normalized relative to the asymmetry that would be expected due to chance alone in a random network of the same density.\n\nMANIA is based on the premise that there is an ideal value (or range of values) of the connectivity threshold that can correctly classify every directed pair of ROIs as either “connection exists” or “connection does not exist”. When such a threshold exists, it will result in a completely symmetric network (because a perfectly accurate tractography-based network cannot be asymmetric). On the other hand, if such an ideal threshold does not exist (for instance, it may be that two connected ROIs are too far from each other and tractography cannot “see” their connection, or that it is impossible for streamlines to cross the white matter/grey matter boundary of a certain ROI in one direction but not in the opposite), then MANIA aims to at least minimize the normalized asymmetry metric, even if the resulting network will not be completely symmetric.\n\nMANIA can work in tandem with probabilistic tractography methods, such as FSL’s probtrackx, PiCo, and fDF-PROBA. It can be also combined with deterministic tractography methods, such as FACT, but only if a large number of streamlines (in the thousands) are generated from randomly placed seeds within each voxel.\n\nWe evaluate the accuracy of MANIA based on synthetically generated data in which the ground-truth network is known. We also compare MANIA with an ideal threshold-based method in which the optimal connectivity threshold is assumed to be known. Further, we show how to associate a confidence level with each edge, and how to apply MANIA in a group of subjects (based on a \"rank aggregation\" algorithm).\n\nAs a case-study, we apply MANIA on diffusion MRI data from 28 healthy subjects to infer the structural network between 18 corticolimbic ROIs that are implicated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nWe measured the “centrality” of each node in the rank-aggregated network, based on four centrality metrics (degree, closeness, betweenness, PageRank). Different centrality metrics focus on different notions of importance. The betweenness centrality of a node X focuses on the number of shortest paths between any pair of nodes that go through X. BA25 (subcallosal cingulate) is the most important node from this perspective because it serves as the “unique bridge” between six ROIs of the limbic system and 9 cortical ROIs. BA25 is also the most central node in terms of its average distance to all other nodes (closeness centrality). Similarly, we measured the edge centrality of all connected node pairs.\n\nIn terms of edge betweenness centrality, the connection between BA25 and the Nucleus Accumbens (Acb) is by far the most central in this network. It is interesting to note that this edge includes the segment of white matter that is the target of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapies for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. In fact, the DBS target is typically the point at which the fibers between (BA25-Acb), (BA25-BA32) and (BA25-BA24) intersect.",

        "text": "Information theory provides a principled and unified statistical framework for neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables (Ince et al., 2016a). This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni- and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods is available at: https://github.com/robince/gcmi\n\nWe validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We demonstrate the benefits of a multivariate statistical approach with examples such as MEG vector magnetic fields (including separate quantification of stimulus modulations of amplitude and direction) as well as considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a two-dimensional response.\n\nA particular advantage of the information theoretic framework is its ability to quantify representational interactions between different neuroimaging responses: for example, different cortical regions, frequency bands, time periods or recording modalities (i.e. simultaneous recorded EEG and fMRI). Such interactions are quantified as redundancy (overlapping information content) and synergy (joint information not available in the individual responses). Conceptually, this is similar to methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis or the cross-classification decoding technique, which quantify the similarity of stimulus representation in different neural responses (but cannot address synergistic effects). However, the information theoretic approach can be applied with a wider range of experimental designs, and to univariate responses, which allows mapping of representational interactions with the full spatial and temporal resolution of the recorded signals.\n\nBy combining the Gaussian copula mutual information estimator and the information theoretic approach to quantifying representational interactions within the Wiener-Granger framework for causal inference, we have developed an approach to measuring functional connectivity that is grounded in specific stimulus information content. We have demonstrated within-subject cross-hemisphere communication of information about eye visibility in a face detection task (Ince et al., 2016b) using sensor space EEG data. We have also developed Directed Feature Information (DFI), a novel measure of directed functional connectivity which quantifies communication about the specific stimulus features subtending perceptual decisions (Ince et al., 2015). These developments allow for network level analyses of functional neuroimaging data that are directly grounded in the representation, processing and communication of specific stimulus features, and so provide the promise of a new perspective on the algorithmic basis of many cognitive functions.",

        "text": "Last years, a significant number of studies appeared in the literature where they presented brain connectivity at resting-state and during cognitive tasks through the development and in both health and disease states. Additionally, there is an increasing amount of studies that focus on cross-frequency coupling which has been proposed to be the key mechanism that coordinate brain dynamics in spatio-temporal scales. Despite the increased number of studies over different experimental neuroimaging datasets, there are many difficulties on comparing results from the same imaging method and the same cognitive task and target group. One of these reasons deal with the adopted connectivity estimator where one can select over  a large repertoire of connectivity estimators for quantifying the strength and also the direction of causal directions in both intra and inter-frequency coupling.  The most frequent connectivity estimators for intra-frequency coupling are the  : coherence (coh), imaginary part of coherence (icoh), mutual information (MI), phase lag index (PLI), weighted phase lag index (wPLI), phase entropy (PE), transfer entropy (TE), granger causality (GC) etc while for cross-frequency couplings are the following: phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) based on modulation index (MI) and (imaginary) phase-locking value ((i)PLV ; Dimitriadis et al., 2015,2016b), the amplitude-to-amplitude coupling (AAC) based on the correlation of the envelopes of two time series and  recently the first cross-frequency estimator for causal interactions between different frequencies, the delay symbolic transfer entropy (dSTE ;  Dimitriadis et al., 2016a).\n\tThere are significant evidence by studying critical brain dynamics for the distinct role of amplitude and phase dynamics at human resting-state (Ton et al., 2015). A recent study based on MEG beamformed signals revealed the dominant information flow within each frequency bands using phase transfer entropy as an appropriate tool for defining the dominant direction of causal interactions between functionally segregated brain networks (Hillebrand et al., 2016). It is significant to discover the dominant direction of causal interactions within and between brain rhythms in both amplitude and phase under a common framework and connectivity estimator.\n In the present preliminary study, i employed dSTE as an appropriate tool to explore  both intra and inter-frequency coupling independently for amplitude and phase but using a common framework through symbolic dynamics (Dimitriadis et al.,2016). Here, i demonstrated a method to estimate transfer entropy (TE) through a symbolization scheme, which is based on neural-gas algorithm (NG) and transforms multivariate time series in the form of multichannel symbolic sequences. Given the symbolic sequences, the delay symbolic transfer entropy (dSTENG) is defined that can uncover the direction, the strength and the delay of causal interactions between and within different frequencies. Our approach is a standard symbolic transfer entropy (STE) that incorporates the notion of ordinal pattern (OP) symbolization technique but using a more efficient neuroinformatic tool for the common symbolization of multichannel recordings, the NG algorithm. We presented the whole analysis using MEG resting-state recordings from an open database (OMEGA). Our results revealed posterior-to-anterior patterns of information flow for high-frequency bands (α,β,γ)  and an opposite pattern for low frequencies (δ,θ)  in both amplitude and phase domain but with different coupling strength and delay of information flux. Additionally, a developmental trend was observed between the two age-groups.\n\nTo conclude, i presented a novel unified method based on Symbolic Transfer Entropy (STE) for detecting causal interactions between and within  frequencies and independently for amplitude and phase domain. Uncovering the different causal profile of amplitude and phase intra and inter-frequency coupling  between the spatial distinct brain networks is essential for a better understanding of the neural dynamics in both healthy and disease brain states.",

        "text": "We have developed a new framework for the analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Whereas current analytic techniques primarily yield static, time-invariant maps of fMRI activity (1), our new technique yields dynamic, time-variant videos of whole-brain fMRI activity. The new framework relies on a fundamentally different method of fMRI BOLD signal extraction. Specifically, instead of the standard volume-based signal extraction, the new method extracts the fMRI BOLD signal based on the veridical MRI slice acquisition times. This yields an fMRI signal that is more temporally accurate (2). In addition, we improved the temporal resolution by presenting each slice to a different point in the progression of the BOLD signal (see also 3). The fMRI BOLD signal is then extracted using non-standard statistical modeling techniques. Specifically, the fMRI data is first broken up into epochs that are time-locked to the onset of a stimulus. Next, in line with techniques used in EEG (4), statistical models are run at each time-point in the epoch. As the baseline we used the fMRI signal intensity values available at time-point 0.  For this particular choice of baseline, modeling involves extracting the fMRI BOLD signal across time points in the epoch. The number of available timepoints in the epoch (and therefore the temporal resolution) is scalable, up to a maximum that is determined by the rate at which MRI slices are acquired (typically on the order of tens of milliseconds). In order to account for the full complexity of the statistical model, we used Linear Mixed Effect modeling (5). Our method yields an fMRI signal for every voxel in the brain that is more temporally accurate and of a much higher temporal resolution that is available in current frameworks.\n\nThe data manipulation in the new framework relies on functions written as part of the neuro-imaging data analysis package FSL (1) and various Python scripts of which the NiBabel package for reading neuro-imaging data forms an indispensable part (6). Statistical modeling of first order individual participant data relied on the data.table and lme4 packages available in the software R (7). Higher order modeling was performed with the randomise function of FSL (8). A key characteristic of the current approach is that it does not rely on data averaging but uses all data points from all epochs in an experiment to model the signal. Advantages of using this pipeline are that statistical modeling of first-order fMRI data is greatly simplified and handled by R. Disadvantages are the slow speed of R, and the large filesizes due to the long data table format requirements imposed by R.\n\nWe will illustrate the new technique in the context of fMRI data collected during a visual object naming experiment. We will use these data to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of the whole-brain fMRI BOLD signal at 390 milliseconds temporal resolution, focusing on task-based functional connectivity. Our new framework can be easily applied to data collected with other types of tasks, and provides a novel opportunity to gain insight into the spatio-temporal dynamics of fMRI activity during cognitive tasks.",

A better understanding of neural development is therefore crucial for a comprehensive picture of the workings of the brain. Computational simulations allow to test models of how neural development occurs, and in particular how it relies on the interaction between genetic instructions and the local, external environment of cells. Hence, these simulations should ideally take into account a number of mechanisms, such as gene regulatory networks, extracellular substance gradients, physical forces and electrical activity.\n\nHere, I present work comprising the detailed modeling of neural development in cortex, as well as preliminary results on retinal development. In particular, I show how certain reaction-diffusion systems can give rise to spatial patterns of chemical guidance cues, enabling the development of a patchy motif of clustered axonal projections in the superficial layers of cortex [1]. Furthermore, neuronal outgrowth processes and synaptic learning rules that give rise to realistic synaptic connectivity as well as winner-take-all (WTA) functionality are presented [2]. Finally, simulations of cortical [3] and retinal lamination (i.e. the sequential layering of different cell types) are shown, providing a powerful computational framework for studying normal and pathological brain development.\n\nOverall, the results of these computational models emphasize the importance of taking into account genetic encoding as well as the 3D physical space within which cells interact, to study brain development. Moreover, this work highlights the necessity of appropriate software for these kinds of simulations, which also require significant computing resources.",

        "text": "In this talk (and accompanying demo), we present a new visualisation of the anatomy and spiking activity in a tadpole spinal cord model. Scientific visualisation is an important technique that allows us to better understand large and/or complex datasets (McCormick et al., 1987). Modern visualisation approaches provide a natural way to demonstrate and highlight important details hidden in data, and to illustrate the interactions and interconnections present. Usually the data concerned have complex three (or higher) dimensional structure, but are typically shown as non-interactive two dimensional images or videos. Our approach to presenting the results of our models is based on virtual reality (VR). This provides a new perspective, bringing the viewer/user closer to the data and allowing them to interact with specific elements in order to access contextualised information in an intuitive and exciting way (Bryson, 1996).\n\nThe dataset that we are visualising consists of the axonal trajectories and physiological (spiking) activity of approximately 1,500 neurons from a model of the Xenopus tadpole spinal cord. In order to create the anatomical part of the data, we use a novel “developmental” approach (Borisyuk et al., 2014). For each neuron, properties such as soma position and dendrite extents are chosen randomly according to a distribution that matches experimental measurements for that particular neuron type. Following this, we simulate the growth of each neuron’s axon according to a set of equations that mimic the response of axon growth cones to chemical gradients. The sensitivities to chemical gradients were chosen using an optimization routine, such that the statistics of the generated axons match those of stained real axons. When the axon of one neuron crosses the dendritic area of another neuron, a synapse is created between the two with some probability. By mapping approximately 80,000 synapses that this process generates onto a network of single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley neurons (with parameters chosen to fit available electrophysiological data (Sautois et al., 2007)), we are able to simulate the spiking activity in the entire spinal cord. This model can produce various physiological behaviours, such as robust swimming in response to sensory input (Roberts et al., 2014) and transient synchronous activity (Li et al., 2014). Our visualisation maintains the integrity of the original data while providing a novel approach to studying them.\n\nThe demonstration consists of two sections: the first is used to provide context and scale, and the second actually visualises the axonal and spiking data. The first section shows the typical swimming behaviour of a tadpole in a natural environment (a rockpool within a lush forest). An important element in VR is the sense of scale (Steuer, 1992) and we take advantage of this in the first section by shrinking the user to a fifth of the size of an average human. This gives the user a different perspective, allowing them to better relate to the tadpole and its size within the environment. The second section takes place inside a “virtual lab” where the user’s scale is reduced even further, to allow them to relate and understand the neurobiological data. The spinal cord is dynamically constructed around the user in order to display the contextualised information in an immersive way (Figure 1). The user is able to play back the results of the physiological simulation, showing how the different neurons interact with each other to produce swimming behaviour. The rendered environment is fully interactive and provides information within context for the user, including labels showing neuron types, their axonal connections, and spiking activity.\n\nWe chose to develop the software with a dedicated game engine (Unity Game Engine, 2016) because of its platform versatility and VR support, although other similar engines are available (see e.g. Unreal Game Engine, 2016). A number of innovative techniques were used, from photogrammetry (Baltsavias, 1999) for building the natural environment, to developing a custom chunking system for optimised rendering (Ebert et al., 2000), which is required due to the size and complexity of the data. At runtime the axonal data are converted into meshes that are optimised for rendering without compromising the integrity of the raw data. All the metadata sits in separate memory structures to the rendering data, allowing for the future possibility of implementing a more dynamic system with adaptable mesh generation and a separate representation of connections between different data chunks.\n\nWe believe that this visualisation approach is general and suitable for many applications beyond our model of the tadpole spinal cord. It could easily be adapted to visualise similar spiking neuron models, either using existing information about the spatial structure of the network or algorithmic techniques to select the clearest possible arrangement of cells. Alternatively, it could also be used to visualise the anatomy of real neural circuits, using anatomical data from experiments. We see significant value in broader application of this visualisation approach both within the neuroscience community and more generally, to provide new tools designed for complex data analysis in virtual reality.",

        "text": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment used for a number of movement disorders, involving the chronic implantation of electrodes into disorder specific regions in the brain. For essential tremor (ET) the targeted brain structure is the ventralis intermedius (ViM) nucleus of the thalamus. ET is a common movement disorder, which affects as many as 4 out of 100 adults over 40 years of age. While the cause of this disorder is unknown, DBS works well, achieving up to 90% improvement in symptoms. However, the mechanisms by which the therapeutic effect is obtained are not fully understood, which in turn slows the process of finding the optimal parameter settings which suppress symptoms and minimise unwanted side effects. DBS additionally provides an opportunity to record the pathological neural activity via intraoperative recordings from the implanted electrodes in the form of local field potentials (LFP) whilst simultaneously recording muscle activity from the affected limbs (EMG). Here, we present data which shows peaks in the EMG-LFP cross spectra within the tremor frequency band (4-12 Hz). To understand the effects of a DBS input on such pathological neural activity, we adopt a computational modelling approach using a population representation of the network hypothesised to underlie ET, namely cortex, cerebellum and thalamus and is based on previous descriptions of the essential tremor network. The model is implemented using the Wilson-Cowan approach, and was simulated by exploring the parameter space to uncover regions which produced oscillatory thalamic activity and we found that the network exhibited oscillatory behaviour within the tremor frequency range. By applying an input to the thalamus simulating the effect of DBS (e.g. 150Hz square pulse), we found that these oscillations are suppressed. Therefore, this study shows that the dynamics of the ET network are able to support oscillations at the tremor frequency. Furthermore, the application of a DBS-like input to such a network disrupts synchronous activity, which could explain one mechanism by which DBS achieves therapeutic benefit.",

        "text": "In our era, as the possible extension of the life span becomes longer each day, the neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose a great threat upon the quality of life. Currently, one of the urgent goals of neuroscientists is to detect AD in its early stages. Since recent treatments and prevention techniques aim at early and presymptomatic stages, studies carried out to present possible biomarkers especially with non-invasive approach are of importance.  For about a decade, the methods investigating non-invasive techniques have the focus on resting state functional connectivity and effective connectivity of neurological disorders. The findings suggest that the distruptions in the networks have a pattern and sequence [1]. Therefore, in this study, the objective is to check the suitability of the non-invasive method tailored to find a distinctive agent for distinguishing AD patients, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and controls from each other by comparing their functional connectivity networks.\nIn this context, fMRI data of five AD, six MCI patients and five controls (with the mean age of 68) are taken while they are doing an optimized auditory oddball task. The data collection is done with T2* weighted GRE-EPI  sequence (1,5T, TR  2400  ms, TE 50  ms, 26 axial slices, 4  mm slice thick, without inter slice gap, matrix 64 × 64, FOV 230 mm) with 275 dynamics (plus two additional dynamics for steady state tissue magnetization). For the high resolution anatomical scan, T1 weighted MPRAGE sequence (voxel size 1.25 × 1.25 × 1.2 mm; 130 slices; FOV 240 mm) is used. As the task, the event related auditory oddball paradigm contains randomized target stimuli having 1500 Hz frequency with 20% probability in between 1000 Hz standard sounds. The stimuli have a duration of 200 ms, and a mean inter-stimulus interval of 2.2 secs (with a min inter-stimulus interval of 1.2 secs).\nIn this study, the preprocessing steps include skull stripping (by FreeSurfer v5.3.0 [2] and BrainSuite v.13a4 [3]), slice timing correction, motion correction, coregistration, normalization and smoothing respectively. All of the steps except skul stripping are done via SPM12b [4] and DARTEL algorithm is chosen for normalization step. In order to achieve the objective, functional connectivity networks are obtained from fMRI data via a group independent component (ICA) approach using temporal concatenation of the subject data by GIFT Toolbox from MIALab [5,6]. For the first step, the initial component number is chosen as thirty by minimum description length criteria and visual inspection. Inside the toolbox, ICASSO algorithm with Extended Infomax is chosen for more stable components whereas GICA3 backreconstruction algorithm is chosen to get the subject related components. As a result, eight different network groups (Figure 1), namely; attentional network, auditory network, cerebellum, default mode network (DMN), frontal network, sensory-motor network, visual network and an unclassifed network are determined by visual inspection of their spatial relatedness with the networks in the literature [6-10]. Then, spatial maps of the components and modulation of the timecourses by the task are compared between the groups statistically.\nIn group comparisons, significant differences among spatial maps of MCI and AD patients are found for small number of voxels (less than 5 voxels) in precuneus region (with FDR correction, p<0.05) favoring the MCI patients. This suggests that functional connectivity in precuneus region is stronger in MCI patients relative to AD patients and it may be due to tissue physiology and athropy related with the stages of the disease [1]. However, since the number of voxels as well as subjects are scarce, this study should be done on a larger group with a stronger (i.e. 3T) machine in order to get more reliable results.\nFor sensory-motor network and auditory network, MCI group independent components (ICs) showed stronger modulation for target sounds when compared to standart sounds (p<0.009) relative to control group. Moreover, when compared to AD group, MCI group showed stronger modulation for standart sounds in their attentional network component (p< 0.003). As for the cerebellum component, the control group showed stronger modulation for the target sounds when compared to MCI and AD patients (p< 0.008). Additionally, when all of the regressors are concerned (target sounds, standart sounds and their time derivatives) MCI patients showed stronger modulation relative to AD patients. There are no modulation by task studies regarding the AD and MCI patients in the literature. But these results have a pattern which can be adressed by the tissue athrophy and compensation for the tissue athrophy mechanisms as stated in [1,11].  In order to get statistically stronger results, the subject number should be increased and a longitudinal study should be carried to confirm the progression of the disease in future studes.",

        "text": "Recently, driving with smart devices like cellphones is becoming a social problem. According to the 2015 report of American Automobile Association (AAA), 60 percent for teenage drivers crashed related to driver distractions and top three causes are interactions with passengers (15%), on the cellphone (12%) and looking at something in the vehicle (10%) [1], suggesting an importance of the measurement of cognitive workloads during the driving [2]. Strayer et al. [3-5] investigated levels of its workload called \"mental workload\" ranging from a single-task to the complex cognitive task such as OSPAN task to be the highest level, which is assumed to exceed the workload in Siri-based interactions. They used P300 amplitude for the criterion of EEG based indexing of the mental workload. The criterion is statistically evaluated in the Oddball paradigm in principle; however it is not suitable for an on-line evaluation in driving without guarantee of rareness as an Oddball task. As a comparative study, we investigated different indexing methods of the mental workload using EEGs such as alpha, beta and theta [6-7] (or its combinations [8-11] and phase lock value [12-15]), for applying to different conditions, in-laboratory and driving simulator (DS) and the real-vehicle environment. In the natural driving condition, transitions of multiple conditions, such as play music, read messages, destination setting by voice recognition as distractions needs to be investigated for validated analysis using EEGs and exploring of possible relations to with psychological measures obtained from the Eye-tracking system including pupil size, blink number and saccade amplitude [16-17].",

For instance, SPM12, FSL and BrainVoyager are widely used for testing the hypotheses about functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, that testing and studying of brain images mostly consist of experts work. It is not fully automatic and time-consuming. There are fractions of decision making processes by the experts that require extensive knowledge and sets of rule of thumb. Systematically, machine learning is expected to automate the process while running the embedded sets of rule of thumb during the process. In addition, pattern recognition is one of the method in machine learning that differ to working principle of SPM12 and its counterpart. The recognizing of patterns in brain images is expected to pragmatically tackle the work of testing the fMRI hypotheses.

        "text": "Deep neural networks (i.e. multi-layer neural networks with multiple layers) are not very practical to use with backpropagation because weights in the lower layer (closer to input) do not typically change significantly during training. Therefore, training often ends in local minima and the performance of the neural networks is typically lower when compared with traditional linear classifiers such as Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or Support Vector Machines (SVM). When novel training methods (commonly referred to as deep learning) have emerged, often combining unsupervized pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning, deep neural networks have become one of the most reliable classification methods. Since deep neural networks are especially powerful for high-dimensional and non-linear feature vectors, electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) are one of the promising applications. Furthermore, to the authors’ best knowledge, there are very few papers that study deep neural networks for EEG/ERP data. [1, 2]\n\nConsequently, the aim of the experiments subsequently presented was to verify if deep learning-based models can also perform well for classification in P300 brain-computer interfaces. The P300 data used were recorded in the EEG/ERP laboratory at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia, and are publicly available in the EEG/ERP portal (http://eegdatabase.kiv.zcu.cz/home.html). The datasets are based on a stimulation with three LED diodes (i.e. target, non-target, and distractor stimuli), and are described in detail in [3]. The Windowed means paradigm [4] was used for feature extraction. The feature vectors consisted of both spatial and temporal features, and had a dimensionality of 133 (7 averaged time intervals for each EEG channel x 19 EEG channels). For training of the classifiers, data from three subjects containing 730 ERP trials were used. For testing, 11 datasets from 11 subjects were used. Stack autoencoders (SAEs) were implemented and compared with some of the most reliable state-of-the-art classification methods: LDA and multi-layer perceptron. The parameters of stacked autoencoders were optimized empirically. The layers were inserted one by one and at the end, the last layer was replaced with a supervized softmax classifier and finetuning using backpropagation was performed. The architecture of the neural network was 133-100-75-60-30-2. For each classifier, average accuracy, precision, and recall, each with the corresponding standard deviation (SD), are listed in Table 1. Fig. 1 depicts achieved classification accuracy for each testing dataset. The performance achieved was comparable with LDA and higher than the performance of the multi-layer perceptron. This result encourages using stacked autoencoders for P300 BCIs.\n\nFor the future work, more issues remain to be addressed. Although stacked autoencoders are less prone to overtraining than MLPs, during the fine-tuning phase, accuracy peaked after approximately 100 iterations and then levelled off slowly. Therefore, an early stopping with a validation set can be considered. It could also be interesting to explore stacked denosing autoencoders, deep belief networks or other deep learning training models. Furthermore, we plan to test deep learning in real on-line BCIs.",

        "text": "1 Background and motivation Intracranial pressure (ICP) after severe brain injuries or similar life threatening conditions can be continuously monitored [1]. The ICP signal contains useful information to predict life threatening conditions such as intracranial hypertension. So far, monitoring approaches are focusing mainly on the relationship between arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Own observation in pediatric patients however, showed that changes in heart rate have direct influence on the ICP.Our hypothesis therefore is that the HR-ICP relationship can be quantified via complex event processing methods. A few works concentrate on the capability of identifying a model describing the intracranial system behaviour. For example in [2] the authors present an estimation algorithm based on hidden state estimation approach and non linear Kalman filters to estimate unobserved variable given some measurements such as ICP and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). What might be interesting is understanding the interelationship between ICP and other measures of the monitored patients. For example in [3] the authors present ApEN an algorithm based on the adaptive calculation of approximate entropy, integrated with a causal coherence analysis that is able to exploit the potential interaction between ICP and R wave intervals [3]. Interesting in this sense is also [4] where the authors extract indeces from beat to beat mean intracranial pressure measurements and intervals between consecutive normal sinus heart beats (ICP and RR intervals). Starting from the visual observation that heart rate and ICP present peaks at similar points, we applied several statistical methodologies to identify such co-occurences of peaks and the relationships existing between the two time series. Moreover we are currently investigating the relationship existing also with the other variables monitored. This preliminary analysis performed appear to be promising and we are now extending our work to perform online peaks detection of ICP peaks considering the relationship between the ICP and HR. 2 Data: ICP and additional variables monitored The dataset we are working on is composed by 38 pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury. For all of the patients, we have the following parameters:abp mean arterial pressure (mmHg),HR heart (rate /min), ICP inracranial pressure (mmHg), AMP intracranial pulse pressure amplitudes ,HRVLFHF heart rate variability (ratio lowfrequency power / high frequency power, HRhfRel percentage of high frequency power ,CPP cerebral perfusion pressure (mmHg). The time series are sampled at a rate of 1.2E-05/second 3 Methods and findings To test and evaluate our initial hypothesis regarding the relationships existing between heart rate pressure and intracranial pressure, we performed a wide range of different statistical analysis. As shown in figure 1 the two series of HR and ICP show a similar behaviour in the peaks patterns. 1 Figure 1: ICP and HR cross talk event detection To further investigate the similar behaviours we firstly performed an analysis in terms of recurrence plots (RP). RP is a statistical analysis technique used for nonlinear data. The data are visualized through a graph in a square matrix (column and rows represents a pair of times), where the elements are representation of the times at which a state of the dynamical system recurred [5]. Mathematically RP represents the time stamps in which the phase space trajectory of the system that we are considering, passes through the same area in the phase space [5] [6]. Figure 2: ICP recurrence plots with embedding dimension 2 The recurrence quantification analysis is a method that quantifies the number and duration of recurrences of a dynamical system presented by its state in the phase space trajectory. Some of these measures include the Recurrence Rate (RR), Determinism (DET), Laminarity (LAM), Ratio (RATIO), Traping Time (TT), Divergence (DIV), Entropy (ENTR), and Trend (TREND). A further description about these measures can be found in [5]. The first visualisation and analysis of the recurrence plots (see figure 2) indicate that there is an existent time pattern, the determinism of the system is significant. Therefore, it is possible to find a model that successfully predicts the behaviour of the series, and can be integrated with other variables such as the Heart Rate. This method can also be further extended by using integrative measurements. Similar to the diagonal-wise defined recurrence rate, the other measures based on the diagonal lines (DET, L, ENTR) can be defined diagonal-wise. These definitions are useful to study interrelations or synchronisation between different systems (using recurrence plots or cross recurrence plots), for instance the first application could be integrating ICP and HR recurrence or cross recurrence plots. An additional analysis we performed was the one considering the cross correlation function. Cross correlation represents the similarity between two signals, as a function of the shift or temporal translation applied to one of the two signals [7] 2 [8]. We performed the cross correlation function between the two time series ICP and HR to further analyse the values of the correlation between them. As we can see from figure 3 there is a correlation between the two time series, therefore this additional exploratory statistical analysis further suggest our initial intuition of a possible relationship between the two signals. 3.1 Wavelets analysis and wavelet coherence A further analysis we performed for understanding the relationship between two time series is the Wavelet Coherence, that is a method able to determine and to visualize areas with high common power (i.e. high common correlation) between two time series [9]. Before performing such test, we checked for the normality of the two time series considering the Shapiro Wilcox Test for normality. Since the test showed normality in the data proposed, we performed the Wavelet Coherence between the two time series, as we can see from figure 3 The resulting plot shows particularly interesting characteristics. In fact it identifies regions (in red) where the two signals are highly correlated and it also tells us in which time instants such correlation happens. This is particularly useful for our analysis, considering the fact that we are looking for correlation in particular time instances (i.e. when peaks occur). Therefore such time instances could be revealed by the Wavelet Coherence graphs. Moreover we performed two additional analysis with wavelets, involving the wavelets correlations and the wavelet clustering. In the first case, the wavelet correlation showed a high correlation between the ICP and HR as we can see from figure 3. In the case of clustering, so far we have analysed the wavelet power clustering considering three time series HR, ICP and HRVLFHF. As we can see from the figure 3 the ICP and HR are clustered together (1 and 2 in the tree) and further from the time series of HRVLFHF supporting even more our hypothesis about similarity between HR and ICP behaviours.

In this way we could try to find correlations between peaks happening in the ICP and in the HR series, seeing the possible temporal correlation between them. This is the first step for a further implementation of peaks prediction algorithm that will be the next step in our study. In the figure 4 we can see the result of the peaks detection algorithm in the ICP series. (a) (b) Figure 4: Example of the application of the peaks algorithm detection we implemented to the ICP time series and to the HR time series. We performed preliminary analysis on peaks detection in HR and ICP and we obtained a significant overlap in the peaks detected in the ICP and HR, suggesting the validation of our initial intuition regarding the possibility of crosstalks events between ICP and HR as well as the possibility for a future utilization of HR information to predict ICP peaks and trends. 4.1 Granger Causality Test A further statistical analysis we are currently performing is the Granger Causality test. Such test [11] check whether it is possible to infer a cause effect reltionship given two time serieses considering the concept of Ganger Causality [12]. We performed preliminary granger test causality on the HR and ICP time series, and first preliminary results on some samples show a significant p-value (0.012) of an existing causal relationship between HR and ICP. Such approach has been widely used also in brain data processing, for references see [13] [14] [15]. 5 Results and Conclusions The preliminary analysis performed on a subset of 3 patients from the cohort of 38 patients, suggests that our initial visual intuation is confirmed from a preliminary statistical analysis of the dataset. The Wavelet Coherence, as well as the peaks detection algorithm and the recurrence plots, confirmed our preliminary hypothesis. We are now further analysing the time series using the Granger Causality method, trying to understand the causality correlations existing between the various time series as well as further develop our methodology to implement an online ICP peaks detection algorithm.",

        "text": "Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It is a complex multisystem disorder encompassing tremor, bradykinesia and posture instability as well as a range of cognitive, autonomic and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) is common with a prevalence of 15-20% at diagnosis, and up to 80% of PD patients may ultimately develop dementia (Hely et al., 2008).\n\nPD-MCI and its posterior dementia stage PD dementia (PDD) contribute to poorer quality of life, increased falls, hallucinations and increased carer burden. The Movement Disorder Society commissioned a Task Force to delineate the guidelines for the clinical diagnostic criteria for PD-MCI by assessing five cognitive domains commonly altered in PD:  executive, attention, memory, semantic fluency and visuospatial perception. These are evaluated using at least two neuropsychological tests per domain (Litvan et al., 2012) and if the patient fails two of these  in any of the cognitive domains, PD-MCI is diagnosed. However, the criteria do not define the exact threshold for passing or failing each of the tests. Previous clinical research has suggested three thresholds to differentiate PD-MCI from PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC): 1.0 standard deviation (SD), 1.5 SD and 2.0 SD below normal cognitive values (Lawson et al., 2014). The most widely used threshold in clinical research is 1.5 SD. However debate still continues as previous investigations have suggested that the 2.0 SD cut-off shows superior sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PD-MCI from PD-NC (Goldman et al., 2013).\n\nMethods: In the current study we assessed three clinical thresholds for diagnosing PD-MCI; 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 SDs using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in patients recently diagnosed with PD (n=99) and clinically classified with a modified PD-MCI criteria; only one test for visuospatial perception was implemented (Yarnall et al., 2014).\n\nRs-fMRI from age matched controls (n=30) was also acquired. From this cohort of controls, we estimated canonical resting state networks (RSNs) using the group MELODIC tool within the FMRIB Software Library toolbox (FSL, v5.0). A total of 70 RSNs were estimated and visually inspected. 26 RSNs were identified of biological interest according to the previous literature and used in our posterior analyses.\n\nIndividual network time series were extracted for each of the canonical RSNs using dual-regression (26 time series per PD participant). Then, inter-network functional connectivity matrices (dimension 26 x 26) were estimated with FSL-Nets. Connectivity matrices were adjusted for age, gender, years of education and Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) by regressing out these covariates from the mean connectivity amplitudes.\n\nDiscriminant analysis of principal components (PC-DA) was implemented with the Classification Toolbox (Ballabio and Consonni, 2013) in Matlab (R2012a Mathworks, Natick MA). For the PC-DA model the feature matrix X was comprised of 99 rows (patients) and 325 column variables which are the connectivity matrix elements. The Classification Toolbox estimated that 16 PCs showed the lowest estimation error for the three MCI thresholds and these PCs were used in all model estimations.\nStatistical significance for all classifications was estimated using non-parametric permutations with classifier accuracy (proportion of correct classifications) as the test statistic. At each permutation, participants were randomly shuffled among the predefined groups and classification accuracy estimated. This was repeated 10,000 times to obtain a null distribution for accuracy.\n\nResults: When the 1.0 SD cut-off is applied, 36 patients were diagnosed as PD-NC (n=36) and 63 patients as PD-MCI (n=63). For the other two thresholds the group ratios were: 1.5 SD - PD-NC (n= 62) and PD-MCI (n= 37), and for 2.0 SD - PD-NC (n=78) and PD-MCI (n=21).\n\nThe classification experiments to differentiate PD-MCI patients from PD-NC for the three criteria thresholds resulted in the following:\n\n*PD-MCI at 1.0 SD: 0.87 sensitivity, 0.72 specificity, 0.82 accuracy, p-value = 0.0005\n*PD-MCI at 1.5 SD: 0.43 sensitivity, 0.82 specificity, 0.67 accuracy, p-value = 0.676\n*PD-MCI at 2.0 SD: 0.33 sensitivity, 0.95 specificity, 0.82 accuracy, p-value = 0.818\n\nConclusions: The results revealed that functional connectivity is able to differentiate MCI in PD. The best classification was obtained for the 1.0 SD threshold, which was the only one that reached significance (p-value = 0.0005). The current results also highlight that rs-fMRI is able to successfully differentiate functional changes at more subtle levels of impairment (1.0 SD below normative values) compared to levels of significant cognitive decline. This suggests that there is an inflexion point in functional activity that can help differentiate PD-MCI from PD-NC and 1.0 SD is the best diagnostic threshold from a resting state network perspective. Further research is needed to assess the clinical criteria for MCI in PD and the neural correlates with other neuroimaging modalities including rs-fMRI, along with its relationship to developing dementia.",

        "text": "INTRODUCTION\nIn contemporary neuroscience understanding how network dynamics arises from the properties of groups of neurons (at different levels of organization) and especially from their connectivity is an extremely challenging job. The structural connections shape large-scale neuronal dynamics which can be captured as patterns of functional and effective connectivity. Functional connectivity describes statistical patterns of dynamic interactions among regions, also called “functional networks,” while effective connectivity attempts to discern networks of causal influences [1]. In most experimental models the anatomical connectivity is only partially known and/or can be partially estimated, therefore, functional connectivity techniques are often used to assess network interaction [2]. The analysis of multiple neural spike trains recorded from experimental models has gained tremendous relevance with the widespread application of Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs). The computational challenge is to come out with a host of data processing and analysis techniques that would enable reliable inference of the underlying functional connectivity patterns [3]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available dedicated software that implements a collection of different methods for functional connectivity analysis of multiple neural spike trains. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop a user-friendly toolbox [4] to provide the researchers community with a powerful tool to perform functional connectivity analysis on in vitro neuronal networks coupled to standard and high-density MEAs. The main objective was to guarantee computational efficiency and accuracy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe used Microsoft Visual Studio with .NET 4.5 framework environment to develop TOOLCONNECT as a standalone windows Graphical User Interface (GUI) application written in C#, with a modular windows forms based implementation. Some dedicated interfaces of the GUI allow the user to: plot the correlograms between each couple of electrodes (for cross- and partial- correlation); thresh and plot the Connectivity Matrix (CM) and the connectivity graph; extract the main topological features (degree, cluster coefficient, path length). One major feature is the toolbox's independence from the acquisition system (e.g., Multi Channel Systems – Reutlingen, Germany, Qwane Biosciences - Lausanne, Switzerland, 3Brain – Wädenswil, Switzerland) and from the MEA layout (number of electrodes and spatial organization). The toolbox offers powerful tools to manipulate data and to perform functional connectivity analysis based on two correlation methods (cross-correlation and partial correlation) and two information theory based methods (transfer entropy and joint entropy). I) Cross Correlation (CC) measures the frequency at which one particular neuron or electrode fires (“target”) as a function of time, relative to the firing of an event in another network (“reference”). Mathematically, CC reduces to a probability Cxy(τ) of observing an event in a train Y at time (t+τ), because of an event in another train X at time t (τ is the time shift or time lag) [5]. II) Partial Correlation analysis allows to distinguish between direct and indirect connections and common input by removing the portion of the relationship between two neural spike trains that can be attributed to linear relationships with recorded spike trains from other neurons [6], [7]. III) Transfer Entropy (TE) is an information theoretic measure able to estimate causal relationships from time series taking into account their past activity [8]. TE is not symmetric with respect to the exchange of the variables (spike trains) X and Y. IV) Joint Entropy is based on the analysis of the cross Inter-Spike-Intervals (cISI): if two neurons are strongly connected the cISI histogram will show a peak and Joint Entropy will be close to zero, otherwise the cISI histogram will be almost flat, and the Joint Entropy will be high [9].\nRESULTS\nWe designed TOOLCONNECT taking care to satisfy the user-friendliness requirement and developed it hiding the algorithm‘s implementation specifics and code’s details. The toolbox’s GUI is intuitive and straightforward to use and permits also to inexperienced users to specify all the input parameters, to perform functional connectivity analysis and to obtain a graphical representation of the results. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the last release of TOOLCONNECT’s GUI. To assess the performances of TOOLCONNECT in terms of reliability, accuracy and computational efficiency, we performed functional-connectivity analysis based on the cross-correlation method on cortical neuronal networks coupled to the MEA60 and the MEA2100 acquisition systems of Multi Channel Systems (MCS) [10] and the BioCam acquisition system of 3Brain Systems [12]. Figure 2 shows the connectivity graphs obtained from the analysis (for further details see [4]).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo the best of our knowledge, TOOLCONNECT is the first functional connectivity toolbox dedicated to the analysis of multiple spike trains recorded from in-vitro neural networks coupled to MEAs, that offers a collection of different connectivity methods and powerful tools to represent all the results in a graphical form through a user-friendly GUI. We developed TOOLCONNECT and implemented all the methods taking care to obtain an optimal resource usage (RAM) and to reduce the computational time. We obtained acceptable performances with computational time lower than 2 minutes (for 10 minutes of recording sampled at 10 kHz), that make TOOLCONNECT suitable for analysis of data from high-density recording systems (e.g., the 4096 electrodes of the 3brain system). Therefore, it will be possible to perform functional connectivity analysis on neural networks with dimensions of thousands of neurons preserving an acceptable spatial and temporal resolution, allowing to obtain realistic and complete information on the dynamics and the topology of such systems.

        "text": "Modelling ionic channels represents a fundamental step to develop realistic neural models. Until recently, the voltage-gated ion-channels have been mainly modelled according to the formalism introduced by the seminal works of Hodgkin and Huxley (HH). However, following the continuing achievements in the biophysical and molecular comprehension of these pore-forming transmembrane proteins, the HH formalism turned out to carry limitations and inconsistencies in reproducing the ion-channels electrophysiological behaviour. On the contrary, Markov-type kinetic models have been increasingly proven to successfully replicate both the electrophysiological and biophysical features of different ion-channels. However, in order to model even the finest non-conducting molecular transition, such Markov models are often equipped with a considerable number of states and related transitions, which make them computationally heavy and not suitable to be implemented in multi-compartmental conductance-based biologically realistic neuron models and large networks of those. In addition, when developing Markov-type kinetic models, the researchers' focus is often on single ion-channels subtypes, so that models independently derived from different subtypes of the same ionic channel can vary considerably, despite the structural similarity between the two isomers.\nIn this study, assuming that a molecular analogy can bear functional similarity, we developed a Markov-type kinetic model for all human voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), which is detailed, global (i.e., it accounts for all ion-channel isoforms) and computationally efficient (i.e. with a minimal set of states and transitions). The study was aimed at bridging the gap between the available studies of individual ion channels and what is needed to develop reliable models for computing neural activity in detailed cell and network models.\nThe proposed model does not take into account the gating currents, in the sense that it does not replicate states and transitions with no effect on macroscopic currents. However, at variance with the HH formalism, it tries to not contradict the known biophysical features of the voltage-gated ionic channels.\nThe real electrophysiological data to be modelled were gathered from previously published studies on whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in mammalian cell lines heterologously expressing the human VGSC subtypes (from Nav1.1 to Nav1.9).\nAs a result, the developed model faithfully replicates the following electrophysiological macroscopic features of every human VGSC subtype: intensity-voltage curves and intensity-voltage relationship, normalized peak conductance-voltage relationship, steady-state current-voltage relationship during fast inactivation (also known as availability after steady-state fast inactivation), recovery from fast inactivation. In addition, the model consistently reproduces the first and second time constants of the decay from activation, as well as the deactivation kinetics, whenever these experimental data are available.\nBy adopting a minimum sequence of states (closed, open, inactivated), and a unique state diagram for all the distinct isoforms, the model ensures the lightest computational load, and the most efficient use in neuron models and neural networks of increasing complexity.\nThe transitions between the states are described by single original ordinary differential equations, which govern the rate of the transitions in function of time and voltage. By simply changing the ‘constant’ parameters of the differential equations the model is able to consistently approximate the functional properties of the distinct channel isoforms.\nIn summary, the kinetic model, developed in the NEURON simulation environment, appears to be the simplest and most parsimonious way for a detailed phenomenological description of the human VGSCs electrophysiological behaviour.\nFinally, a comparison with a modified version of a HH model, as well as some examples of the use of the same kinetic model with other voltage-gated ion-channels are provided.",

        "text": "Experimental evidence suggests that neurons and neural circuits display stochastic variability [1] and, therefore, it is important to have neural models that capture this stochasticity. There are basically two types of noise model for a neuron [2]: (1) spike generation is modeled deterministically and noise enters the dynamics via additional stochastic terms; or (2) spike generation is directly modeled as a stochastic process. Recently, Galves and Löcherbach [3] introduced a neural model of the latter type in which the firing of a neuron at a given time t is a random event with probability given by a monotonically increasing function of its membrane potential V. The model of Galves and Löcherbach (GL) has as one of its components a graph of interactions between neurons. In this work we consider that this graph has the structure of the Potjans and Diesmann network model of a cortical column [4]. The model of Potjans and Diesmann has four layers and two neuron types, excitatory and inhibitory, so that there are eight cell populations. The population-specific neuron densities and connectivity are taken from comprehensive anatomical and electrophysiological studies [5-6], and the model has approximately 80,000 neurons and 300,000,000 synapses. We adjusted the parameters of the firing probability of the GL model to reproduce the firing behavior of regular (excitatory) and fast (inhibitory) spiking neurons [7]. Then, we replaced the leaky integrate-and-fire neurons of the original Potjans-Diesmann model by these stochastic neurons to obtain a stochastic version of the Potjans-Diesmann model. The parameters of the model are the weights we and wi of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights of the GL model [3]. We studied the firing patterns of the eight cell populations of the stochastic model in the absence of external input and characterized their behavior in the two-dimensional diagram spanned by the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights. For a balanced case in which the network activity is asynchronous and irregular the properties of the stochastic model are similar to the properties of the original Potjans-Diesmann model. Different neural populations have different firing rates and inhibitory neurons have higher firing rates than excitatory neurons. In particular, the stochastic model emulates the very low firing rates of layer 2/3 observed in the original model and also experimentally [4]. We also submitted the network to random input spikes applied to layers 4 and 6 to mimic thalamic inputs, as done by Potjans and Diesmann [4], and studied the propagation of activity across layers. In conclusion, the stochastic version of the Potjans-Diesmann model can be a useful replacement for the original Potjans-Diesmann model in studies that require a comparison between stochastic and deterministic models.",

        "text": "Introduction\nWe present a methodology for optimising the parameter values of a neuron morphology generator. To date, neuron morphology generators have only been optimised by hand or by means not well defined in the literature. We optimise a neuron generator similar to that proposed by Koene [1] by approximately matching features extracted from both generated and ground truth neurons using probabilistic programming and Bayesian optimisation. We have created a software package capable of carrying out this task for a given set of ground truth neurons.\nOne use of a model trained by our method is probabilistic neuronal tracing, using the generative model to propose potential elongations that are scored and continued as appropriate. This approach may be used as a top-down prior for automated segmentation of connectomics data, such as the data presented by Kasthuri [2].\n\nPrior Art\nAll neuron morphology generators are parametrised so that the neurons that are generated can be changed by altering the value of the parameters. Some generators use prior distributions to constrain the generated neurons [3, 4]; such as the number of bifurcations each neuron will contain. Other generators define governing equations and parameters that allow for conditional generation; Tamori [5] focuses on relating branch angles to branch diameters, while Koene [1] uses distributions for branching and elongation, conditional on local morphological features. Constrained generators allow for very straightforward matching of morphological details measured from ground truth neurons, such as branch lengths and topological symmetries. But require significant work to extend the algorithm to model other neuronal classes, where the inherent structure is different. Conditional generators have the advantage of being less constrained and hence can extend more easily to other morphologies. However they require more sophisticated optimisation techniques as the parameter values are not directly measurable from the training data.\nWe wish to find the optimal parameter values that create neurons most similar to the target morphologies. The optimal posterior parameter values m*, can be defined as:\nm* = argmax{K(Y, D)p(Y|X)p(X|m)}\nwhere m is a combination of parameter values. X is a neuron morphology generated by the neuron generator. The distribution p(X|m) denotes the probability of any neuron morphology with parameter values m. p(Y|X) is a deterministic feature transform given a neuron morphology X and returning a feature set Y. K is a utility function that penalises the distance between the generated feature set Y and the feature set of the ground truth data, D. We are unable to calculate gradients of the likelihood p(Y|X), and of the generative program p(X|m), with respect to m. Therefore, we must use likelihood free inference methods [6].\nOne such likelihood free method is Bayesian optimisation (BO) [7]. The optimiser evaluates the utility K(Y, D)p(Y|X)p(X|m) for a number of different parameter settings and fits a Gaussian process (GP) to the resulting points. The optimiser then uses an acquisition function that trades off exploring the space (regions of high variance in the GP) against exploiting the currently optimal value.\nThis approach can be applied to optimising the parameter values of the conditional generator proposed by Koene [1].\n\nMethods\nUsing these tools, we created software for the optimisation of parameter values for the conditional conditional generator proposed by Koene [1]. Other neuron generators impose a set of sub-classes on the morphology, such as trunks, tufts and collaterals. This not only prevents rigorous automatic optimisation, as each sub-class must be optimised individually, but in our experience, may be unnecessary. Therefore, we only uniquely parametrise axonal, basal and apical arbours. The user imports a repository of morphology files (such as those hosted on NeuroMorpho [8]) and once optimised returns a parameter set that allows for generation of statistically similar neurons to those in the repository.\nDifferent subsets of parameters in the model require different learning strategies. Some parameters are fixed, such as branching angles and stem diameters. These fixed parameters are normally easily identifiable and have some direct interpretation in morphology. As such, these can be extracted at runtime using a feature extraction program such as L-Measure [9]. To learn the remaining parameters, the utility function K(Y,D) must be derived to represent the ‘goodness’ of a particular set of parameter values. To do this we extract a number of features, such as the average terminal branch order, number of bifurcations and spatial extent using L-Measure. We then take the Euclidean distance between the feature sets obtained from ground truth and generated neurons. This distance is inverted to yield the aforementioned utility, and is minimised using BO as described earlier.\n\nResults and Discussion\nWe used the outlined methodology to optimise the parameter values for generation of von Economo neurons [10]. Several different tools are available to us for analysing the generated neurons. Firstly, comparison of parameter values via L-Measure confirms that the distributions for each of the features match. Those values that are measured and directly implemented are normally an exact match. Secondly, manual inspection of the generated arbours can be used to compare the parameterisation. There is clear concurrence between the generated and the ground truth. However, some of the neurons generated are poor due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm, i.e. some bifurcate at extreme angles. This suggests the trade-off associated with using a more generalised parametrisation – the arbour appears to be an ‘average’ of the whole arbour in the ground truth data. This was expected, but the degradation in output is small compared to the considerable simplification in the code base as well as permitting automated analysis of a wider range of neurons.\n\nFuture Work\nWe have presented a methodology for optimising the parameter values of a neuron morphology generator using feature extraction, probabilistic programming and Bayesian Optimisation. Our approach works particularly well for neurons whose arbour is homogenous. Accordingly, one improvement could be to modify the routine to better represent any heterogeneous in the underlying structure of the neuron. Improvements to the generative model such as taper, termination of branches and introducing a prior over arbour shape could improve the quality of the generated neurons.",

In order to quantify cells in an objective manner, we followed a twofold approach: on one hand to address image noise, we extract wide range of geometrical features using Laplacian of Gaussian operator (Duits 2003), Gaussian Derivative operator, Bi-Laplacian of Gaussian operator and scale representation generated by Anisotropic decomposition of the Laplacian (Anisotropic filter, ALoG Filter (Weickert 1998)& (Lindberg 1994)). On the other hand to exploit the geometrical features we propose a semi-supervised active learning technique that will allow us to interactively collect new training examples in a robust manner involving little human attention. The initial learning model is built with few training examples and used to predict the unseen training instances. The user will provide feedback on this prediction. This process is continued till user is satisfied with the outcomes. After that, the model will be used to predict the unseen testing images. We are implementing an interactive framework in ImageJ using Weka as learning framework. The resulting framework is general enough to learn models for different kind of tissues and dendritic trees etc and able to adapt new learning task. The technique is successfully applied to two-photon images and comparisons are done with threshold based learning approaches, where the learning model is sensitive to global or a local threshold parameters. The extracted features are tested with wide range of machine learning classifiers like Support Vector machines, Naive Bayes Classifier etc to check the generality of features.",

        "text": "The mammalian cortex is composed of six main cell layers with distinct form and function. This laminar structure is the result of a complex developmental process, which is implicitly specified in the genetic code, but contingent upon extracellular factors. Computational modeling provides a valuable approach for a better understanding of this dynamic process [1]. Here, we present a computer model to put in comparison the development of normal and pathological laminar organization. In particular, we investigated scenarios where the migration of certain cells does not take place properly, such as for example in the neurodevelopmental disease periventricular heterotopia (PH) [2]. In PH, certain neurons that have failed to migrate into the developing cerebral cortex remain as nodules or neurons that line the ventricular surface.\n\nTo implement our model we used the software framework Cx3D [3], which is a software framework for simulations of neural development in 3D physical space. Based on this model, we simulate a gene regulatory network, which by differentiation, proliferation and migration of cells gives rise to a laminated structure. By introducing defects to our artificial genetic code, our simulations yield results that are in good accordance with experimental observations. Overall, our results constitute a comprehensive model for the laminar disorganization in PH, which can also be applied to better understand many other neurodevelopmental trajectories of brain disorders.",

        "text": "Introduction\"\"\"\"Music listening is effective at recruiting a wide range of areas in the brain [1]. The decoding approach, that aims to describe stimuli or conditions in terms of changes in the neural activations [2], has been employed to investigate the neural processing of musical features using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during naturalistic music listening. A modest accuracy has been reached at predicting low- and high-level musical features [3]. The accuracy levels suggest subject-specific differences in the neural processing of musical material. In one of the few studies on subject-specific differences in the neural recruitment during music listening, [4] linked musical training to an increased functional symmetry in multiple regions of the brain. Decoding demographic attributes, such as psychiatric conditions, based on the whole-brain connectivity has received increased attention [5]. However, this type of approach has not been employed with musical stimuli and musically relevant variables, such as musicianship. Moreover, past research has not attempted to model subject-specific differences on the basis of the patterns of brain responses to music stimulus features. The present study aims to decode musicianship based on the neural processing of musical features in naturalistic music listening.\"\"\"\"Materials and Methods\"\"\"\"FMRI data acquisition and preprocessing\"\"\"\"An equal number of musically trained (n=18) and untrained (n=18) participants participated in an fMRI experiment. This data has previously been used in [4]. Three musical pieces covering distinct musical genres were used: (i) Stream of Consciousness by Dream Theater (rock/metal); (ii) Adios Nonino by Astor Piazzolla (tango); and (iii) Rite of Spring Part I, episodes 1-3 (classical music) by Igor Stravinsky. Participants’ brain responses were acquired while they attentively listened to each of the musical stimuli. Scanning was performed using a whole-body scanner, and slices covering the whole brain were acquired at 0.5Hz. fMRI data was preprocessed as in [4]. Last, the fMRI volumes were parcellated into 116 regions according to the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. The regional mean time-series were estimated by within-region voxel averaging.\"\"\"\"Musical feature processing\"\"\"\"An approach similar to that in [1] was employed for musical feature extraction and processing. 25 musical features related to timbre, rhythm and tonality were extracted from the stimuli using the MIRToolbox [6]. The temporal evolution of features was extracted using a time frame-based approach. To make the data comparable with the fMRI data, each of the features were convolved with a double-gamma Hemodynamic Response Function, de-trended by spline interpolation and temporal filtering, and down-sampled to 0.5Hz. The musical features were then subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax rotation to map the data to six components labeled as Fullness, Brightness, Activity, Timbral Complexity, Pulse Clarity, and Key Clarity.\"\"\"\"Decoding\"\"\"\"A multi-stage modeling approach was employed for the decoding. First, the region-based fMRI data for all participants was concatenated in time, and each region was z-score transformed to zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Group-PCA [7] with a low number of components was run on the data to smooth out noise and to reduce the data dimensionality. Separately for each participant, the data was then time-aligned with the musical features, cross-covariance was computed between the regions and features, and the resulting matrix for each participant was vectorized. Then, the z-score transformation was performed over participants was performed. L1-norm penalized linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained to predict the musicianship from the cross-covariances, as it is robust against irrelevant features. The cost parameter controlling the number of retained features was optimized for each model in an inner cross-validation (CV) loop.\"\"\"\"To obtain realistic decoding performance estimates, an outer CV loop across participants was run ten times following the leave-one-subject-per-group-out (LOSGO) strategy [5]. Random partitioning of the participants was used at each run and the obtained accuracies were pooled. The three musical stimuli were concatenated in time for the main analysis, appropriating an overall view of the neural processing related to multiple musical styles.\"\"\"\"Results and Discussion\"\"\"\"The classification accuracy (FIG1) obtained with the concatenated stimulus depended on the number of principal components used, reaching the peak at three components (M=0.681, SD=0.026). This accuracy is statistically significant at p < 0.05 based on Monte-Carlo sampling. When training and testing with each individual stimulus (FIG2), the mean classification accuracy did not reach the significance level of p=0.05 except for Piazzolla at three components. This may indicate the lack of variability in the musical material within these stimuli, leading to less stable covariances.\"\"\"\"The contribution of different neural regions and musical features in the optimal models (three components, concatenated stimulus) were assessed by examining the feature coefficients in the SVM models as well as the principal component loadings, averaged across the CV runs and folds. The most important features predicting group membership included increased activation in the auditory network in musicians and in the salience network in non-musicians during moments of high timbral complexity and low fullness (PC3). This may indicate musicians' greater ability to efficiently process complex musical material. Furthermore, moments of high activation and unclear tonality were associated with higher activation in the executive control and salience networks and frontal regions in musicians (PC2). This may suggest that musicians, because of their training, were performing more efficient tonal prediction. Finally, high overall activation during moments of high brightness was found to predict musicianship (PC1). This may indicate higher efficiency of timbral processing in musicians.\"\"\"\"Conclusions\"\"\"\"A moderately high accuracy was achieved at decoding musicianship from neural processing of musical features, and distinct processing patterns at various brain areas for different musical features were discovered between musicians and non-musicians. This suggests a profound connection between musical training and music perception. This also highlights the need to take into account the demographic attributes when studying music processing in the field of neuroinformatics. However, a modest and unstable accuracy achieved with stimuli representing individual musical styles warrants further study on the effect of musical styles on music perception and processing.",

        "text": "Anatomically and biophysically detailed conductance-based neuronal models can be useful tools in understanding the behavior and function of neurons. Although there are more and more experimental data available that constrain the many parameters of multi-compartmental models, there are generally several remaining parameters whose values have not been experimentally determined. The values of these unknown parameters are often set using manual, ad hoc procedures with the aim of reproducing the behavior of the cell in one or a few specific paradigms. However, the performance of such a model outside the original context typically remains unexplored, and systematic comparisons of different models are difficult and thus rare, limiting the reusability of these models. Recently, several solutions have been developed for the systematic optimization of neuronal parameters based on the quantitative evaluation of model performance, but customizing these tools to individual needs can be a substantial challenge. To overcome these problems we are developing software tools for automatic model validation, and for the automated, intuitive fitting of unknown model parameters.\n\tFor automatic and quantitative model validation we are developing a python test suite, called hippounit, which is based on NeuronUnit, a SciUnit repository for testing neuronal models (Gerkin and Omar, 2014). Hippounit automatically performs simulations that mimic experimental protocols on detailed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models built in the NEURON simulator. To test a model the user needs to create a python class for the model, including its intrinsic mechanisms, and receptor models can also be added for synaptic stimulation of the model cell. The tests of hippounit use feature-based error functions to compare the output of the model to the results of experimental measurements on several different cells. Errors are typically measured as the difference from the mean of the experimental data, measured in the units of the experimental standard deviation (Druckmann et al. 2007). The final output of a test is an error score that is the sum of the errors of all the features tested by the given test, and a number of figures which illustrate the model's behavior and the extracted feature values. Beside hippounit's own functions, the Electrophys Feature Extraction Library (eFEL) of the Blue Brain Project is used for feature extraction. So far there are three different tests implemented in hippounit. The Somatic Feature Test uses the somatic spiking features of eFEL for parameter fitting; target values for these features were extracted from recordings in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons in the laboratory of Alex Thomson. The Depolarization Block Test aims to determine whether the model enters depolarization block in response to prolonged, large-amplitude current injections to the soma, using experimental data from Bianchi et al. (2012). Finally, the Oblique Integration Test probes the integration properties of oblique dendrites according to the experimental results of  Losonczy and Magee (2006). Using hippounit, we have compared the behavior of several CA1 pyramidal cell models in these domains, and found that all of these models perform well in some domains (typically on features they were built to capture) but badly in others.\n\tWe also present the improvements made in the Optimizer software tool since its initial release (the version described in Friedrich et al., 2014). Optimizer is a general-purpose tool for fitting the parameters of neuronal models. Optimizer offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for non-expert users to do optimization in several commonly used scenarios. It implements several different optimization algorithms and a number of fitness functions which can also be combined. Optimizer has a modular structure that makes it easy to extend it by adding new optimization algorithms and/or fitness functions. Recently added optimization methods include random search, and the differential evolution and particle swarm algorithms from the inspyred package.  The scipy version of simulated annealing, which has been deprecated, has been replaced by the basinhopping algorithm (also in scipy). The software can now handle a combination of voltage traces and corresponding explicit spike times; this is important for the correct optimization of integrate-and-fire models. Several bugs have been fixed; most importantly, when selecting parameters for optimization in the GUI, only actual parameters (and not state variables) of Neuron models are displayed. In addition, the software now can handle abstract data that are already extracted from traces, and use fitness functions extracted from a set of traces (the model's responses to different stimuli) rather than a single trace. These capabilities have been used  to fit the behavior of a CA1 pyramidal cell model to the somatic spiking features and the depolarization block features described above. The performance of several optimization algorithms in Optimizer has been systematically compared on some benchmark problems, including the optimization of both conductance-based and integrate-and-fire models. We concluded that the classic evolutionary algorithm included in Optimizer was effective in solving all types of problems, while the basinhopping algorithm performed well in the case of conductance based models (and continuously varying features) but not in the case of integrate-and-fire models with discrete feature values.\n\tAutomated tools for model fitting and validation should enable a more principled and systematic approach to model building and validation. Together with efforts on other important components such as standardized model representation, such tools should make possible the reproducible construction, validation, and comparison of detailed neural models, and encourage collaborative research in computational neuroscience.",

These transitions are obtained by a very simple analytic mean-field calculations that is exact for networks with all-to-all coupling. The second order transition is described by a critical line $\\gamma_c W_c = 1$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the average neuronal gain and $W$ is the average synaptic weight. On this line we have neuronal avalanches with standard mean-field exponents of the Directed Percolation class. The usual procedure for obtaining self-organization to criticality is to use dynamical synapses $W_{ij}[t]$ with fixed gains $\\gamma_i$. Here we propose a new biological mechanism toward self-organized criticality (SOC) based in dynamical neuronal gains $\\gamma[t]$ with fixed\nsynapses $W_{ij}$. We show that SOC can be achieved because the stationary value for the average gain $\\gamma^*$\nsatisfies the critical condition $\\gamma^* W = 1$.",

        "text": "Integrate-and-fire model and Hodgkin-Huxley model are known as basic mathematical models that describe the change of membrane potential. In these models, the structure of neurons is neglected; neurons are regarded as material points. On the other hand, spatial neuron models consider morphological structure such as soma, dendrites and axons. Spatial neurons are composed of equipotential segments called “compartments” connected with axial resistances. Change of membrane potential in each compartment is described by a partial differential equation (PDE) called a cable equation. In general, a cable equation is descretized both in time (implicit) and space. Then, linear simultaneous equations are obtained and we solve them to calculate membrane potential for each compartment and time step [1].\nBecause writing a program to solve the equations is difficult, dedicated simulation software such as NEURON and GENESIS are used. However, they have two issues. First, they do not support modern computing accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs). They employ a data structure called array of structure, which typically compromises the parallel computing capability of accelerators. Second, they use basic numerical method called Gaussian elimination to solve linear simultaneous equations. Gaussian elimination is known that having computational complexity O(N^3) in the case of N th-order dense matrices. Thus, calculation amount is too increasing as the coefficient matrix is huge. On the other hand, there is a numerical method called a conjugate gradient method (CG method) to solve linear simultaneous equations. A CG method is a series of dot products and matrix-vector products. Also, the coefficient matrix does not change during calculation by a CG method. By these reasons, CG methods are known much faster and more efficient than Gaussian elimination, when the coefficient matrix is huge and sparse.\nHigh-performance computing (HPC) technology is important for efficient numerical simulation. In particular, recent advances of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) are tremendeous. GPGPU is the technology in which GPUs are used as parallel computing hardware owing to the many core architecture that is originally intended for computer graphics. In GPGPU, it is important to divide a large amount of calculation into a number of independent small calculations. Because spatial models tend to have compartments having the same dynamics among themselves, it is easy to calculate in parallel on GPUs.\nThe purpose of this study is to develop our own software for numerical simulation of spatial models on GPUs. We used programming library called CUDA C which is a kind of GPGPU technology and based on C language [2]. First, we implemented the CG method considering that the coefficient matrix obtained by descretizing a cable equation is sparse and symmetrical positive definite. A CG method was implemented by using a modern CUDA technology called “Dynamic Parallelism” that a kernel code can invoke other kernel code. In this way, the entire algorithm of the CG method was implemented in a kernel code, which means that there is no need to return to the host code for each iteration. In the CG method, because zero elements in a coefficient matrix are not necessary, the sparse matrix was represented by the compressed row storage (CRS) format. A Dot product implemented on one thread and shared memories. Matrix-vector product was implemented by using one thread per one row. Second, we implemented parallel calculation of ion channels and gate variables on a GPU. They were calculated by using one thread per one compartment. Third, we implemented parallel calculation of multiple cells by using CUDA technology called “Stream” that manage many tasks on a GPU. They were calculated by using one stream per one cell.\nAs a result, our software succeeded to carry out a simulation of a spatial model of Purkinje cells developed by De Schutter and Bower (1994) [3], which is composed of 1,600 compartments having 10 ion channels and 13 gate variables for each compartments (Figure1). Specifically, we conducted the following three experiments. First, a simulation using the CG method realized 100 times faster calculation than that using Gaussian elimination for one Purkinje cell on a CPU with temporal resolution of 20 microseconds for 5,000 iteration. Second, the GPU (using Tesla K40c) version realized 3 times faster calculation than that a single-threaded CPU version for 15 Purkinje cells. Third, we compared the performance of the CG method we implemented with these implemented using CUSPARSE and CUBLAS libraries developed by NVIDIA (Figure2).\nSummarizing, spatial model simulation using our software with the aid of GPGPU was faster than that on NEURON and GENESIS. We will improve out software to simulate spatial neuron models faster and more accurate.",

        "text": "In this research, we developed the scheme to estimate the neural circuit with biophysically detailed model. CMA-ES, a kind of evolutionary computation, was used for fitting the model to the data acquired from the physiological experiment. We used this method to understand the neural mechanism of the premotor area of silkworm moth (Bombyx mori) which generates the behavioral commands of the odor-source searching behavior.  The odor-source searching behavior is one of the typical behaviors of animals that have high adaptability and robustness towards the environment. To investigate this behavior, we observed silkworm moths. Male silkworm moths show an especially remarkable zigzag searching locomotion initiated by a lump of sex pheromone as they navigate through the plume of pheromone [1]. Our purpose is to make a model of the neural networks which control the odor-source searching behavior of silkworm moths.  Previous works have partially revealed the neural mechanisms of the odor-source searching behavior of silkworm moths. Firstly, the flip-flop response of the group I/II descending neurons corresponds to the locomotion [2]. Secondly, the premotor center that generates the flip-flop pattern is identified as Lateral Accessary Lobe – Ventral Protocerebrum (LAL-VPC). Thirdly, physiological and morphological records at the single-cell level in that region were obtained and stored in the database [4].  However, the detailed network model is not yet to be known because of how complicated the neural network is. This level of complexity makes it hard to determine the model by hand-tuning. In addition, it is also difficult to estimate the activity parameters of the each cell alone [5]. There are previous works of research that tackled this problem by using restricted Artificial Neural Network model and intended to replicate the behavior [6]. However, the expression ability of the model was limited compared to a real neural circuit. Moreover this method could only tell us a map from input to output, so was not suitable for the detailed investigation of the effect of the neural factors such as the morphology, the membrane properties of the cells, the connectivity of the network and the physical positions of the connections.  Thus, we included these detailed information. We employed an estimation method\nwhich can treat these factors as the evaluation parameters. With the increase in complexity of the model, the computational complexity is increased. In order to overcome this difficulty, we executed the simulation in the hierarchically parallelized environment. The estimated parameters will be used to investigate the effect of the aforementioned elements.\nFor achieving our purpose, we used the multi-compartment model to represent the morphology of the cells, and the evolutionary computation to estimate the parameters. The simulation was executed on a supercomputer to tackle the problem of the complexity of the model. We built the multi-compartment model in NEURON K+ simulator [7]. Hodgkin-Huxley type model with the Ca2+, the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, and the A-current channel [8] was calculated in each compartment. To estimate the parameters, the evolutionary computation called Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) [9] was used. The input (in this case, pheromonal stimulus) and the output (the flip-flop response of the descending neurons) were fixed and the internal parameters were searched. The evaluation parameters were the activity factors of the firing model and the cellular connections. The evaluation was carried out by measuring the difference between the actual and the estimated response of the output cell in each generation. This will be the first method estimating neural circuits with biophysically detailed model. Because of the good compatibility to the highly parallelized computation, we used CMA-ES. Combining these methods allows us to quantitatively evaluate the target value which has been estimated empirically or by hand-tuning.\nIn the preliminary simulation, we verified the effectiveness of this approach by solving the simplified problem. Concretely, the single-compartment model was used to represent the morphology of the cells, and the number of cells in the network was reduced. After that, the input and the output signals were fixed, and whether the method could estimate the connection parameters or not was investigated (fig. a). The number of cells in the network was 6, and the Excitatory-Inhibitory ratio was 2:1. The network was fully connected, and the connection weight and delay were used as the evaluation parameters. The dimension of parameter space was 72. The hyper-parameter was set as followings; the number of gene was 4096, the number of the selected elites was 64, and the number of generation was 55. To simulate a cell with the single-compartment model, the activity parameters were fitted to the measured data in\nterms of the maximum firing rate and the attenuation factor. We showed one example of the target function and a result of estimation (fig. b, c). We got the expected results about the activity curve. The shape of arch, and increasing and decreasing pattern were fairly fitted to the target data.\nIn the future, we are going to estimate the real LAL-VPC network with single and morphological multi-compartment model. Specifically, we are interested in the property of the neural circuit which generates flip-flop neural activity in response to the stochastic pheromonal input. The more parameters are used, the worse the convergence and the calculation time of the estimation are. As a countermeasure for this difficulty, we will extend our method based on the technique called CMA-TWEANN [10]. In this study, we are estimating the brain of silkworm moth, but our method can be generalized. Therefore, if the input and the output are defined, this method can be applied to the estimation of the neural networks of any other species (even humans).",

        "text": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by problems in protein synthesis causing misfolded proteins. Unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response, has a role in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, using four basic functions. In Huntington’s Disease it has been observed that there is an amount of misfolded huntingtin in the cytoplasm, as well as reduced amount of molecular chaperones leading to the reduction of their role. Molecular chaperones, are proteins, which act in a dynamic manner in cases of stress or misfolding, and are involved in the quality control system of the cell.\nAge –related changes in the mechanisms of chaperones action, lead to the eventual failure of protein defense system. Deciphering protein-protein interactions will help to the identification of specific causal pathways in protein aggregation and better understanding of the unfolded protein response.\nThis work will use neuroinformatics’ methods in order to design in vitro techniques that will examine the density of chaperones in HD cells, as well as the effectiveness of the UPR.  The elucidation of the complex response of UPR will help to test new therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "text": "Changes in synaptic strength are believed to be the neuronal basis of learning and memory. A multitude of experimental protocols have been used to induce such long-term synaptic plasticity. However, the exact amplitude of change, the duration of the effect and its locus of expression (pre- or postsynaptic) is often variable. The underlying causes for these variabilities have remained unclear. Here we introduce a framework in which long-term plasticity aims to optimize synaptic transmission statistics towards a presumed target strength. Consequently, the exact pre- and postsynaptic states at the time of plasticity induction determine the observed ratio of pre/post modifications. Using this framework we can predict the locus of synaptic changes observed in individual hippocampal and neocortical potentiation and depression experiments. We show that it is more efficient to long-term depress synapses presynaptically as has been observed experimentally. Furthermore, our framework captures the expression locus of plasticity across different synaptic states. We demonstrate that the distance to the target - the prediction error - is calculated postsynaptically and that the presynaptic changes are controlled through feedback release of nitric oxide and endocannabinoids. Finally, our framework suggests an excitatory-inhibitory statistical balance in which the statistics of inhibitory synaptic transmission are tuned through long-term plasticity to balance neural activity by targeting the mean excitatory conductance.  By showing that during long-term plasticity, synaptic response statistics are optimized towards a functional target, our work may lay to rest the long standing pre/post debate, help to explain the high degree of variability in weight modification typically observed in experiments.",

Until a decade ago, efforts for large scale simulations had often concentrated on simplifying neuron models to achieve fast execution. However, advances in parallel computing make it now possible to simulate massive networks in acceptable execution times, even for models with computationally costly building blocks. We have previously shown that it is possible to simulate spiking neural network models that consist of user-defined flexible building blocks on GPUs using the GeNN framework, with up to 200-fold speedup compared to a single core of a CPU (Yavuz et al. 2016). \"\"\"\"Here, we present a model of the honeybee olfactory system implemented on the GPU using the GeNN framework (Yavuz et al. 2016). The model includes biologically realistic building blocks, including models of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs) and local interneurons (LNs) in the antennal lobe, and Kenyon cells (KCs) and feedback neurons (FNs) in the mushroom body (Fig. 1). ORNs are modelled using Poisson spike sources, which are modulated by receptor kinetics (Rospars et al. 2008). PNs and LNs are modelled using Hodgkin-Huxley type conductance based neuron models. The connectivity between ORNs, PNs and LNs is chosen so that responses in PNs fit to calcium imaging data obtained with backfills of PNs (Nowotny et al. 2013, Ditzen 2005). KCs are modelled using a Hodgkin-Huxley model, which was specifically developed based on current and voltage clamp recordings of KCs in honeybees (Wüstenberg et al. 2004). The model includes synapses with a custom three-factor learning rule which modulates the weights as a function of co-activation of pre- and post-synaptic neurons, and expectancy and presence of reward. The model can successfully reproduce KC spiking behaviour in response to presence of an odour, and can accomplish basic reinforcement learning tasks. \"\"\"\"The modular and flexible structure of GeNN makes it possible to run the model on various platforms, such as GPU workstations and NVIDIA Tesla devices in High Performance Computing clusters, but also on the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 embedded module for controlling a wheeled robot. It is also possible to use the model as a part of a bigger model which would include other pathways of the honeybee brain. Simulating the full-size insect brain using this approach would provide further insights into how holistic behaviour could emerge from the interaction between the building blocks, and make it possible to use a computational brain model as a robotic controller in order to perform complex tasks that insects can accomplish despite the small size of their brains.\"\"\"\"Figure 1: Network connectivity and evoked response profiles in the model of the honeybee olfactory system.

        "text": "Introduction\nThe role of the cerebellum in motor learning has been demonstrated through neurophysiological studies [1] and computational models [2]. The organized modular circuit and neural plasticity at different sites are essential to achieve adaptation and memory of cerebellar motor commands during specific tasks. In particular, plasticity in the cerebellar cortex is the main mechanism driving learning [3]: Long Term Potentiation (LTP) and Depression (LTD) change the activity of Purkinje Cells (PCs) that modulate the cerebellar output. Animal experiments have shown that a damage to cortical LTD prevents from adaptation in cerebellum-driven tasks, like Eye-Blinking Conditioning (EBC) and Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) [4]. During EBC, after the repeated paired presentation of a Conditioned Stimulus (CS) and an Unconditioned Stimulus (US), the subject learns to produce a Conditioned Response (CR) anticipating US [5]. During VOR, when the subject is looking at a target and the head is moving, a compensatory eye motion keeps the gaze fixed on the target [6].\nIn both tasks, the cerebellum controls the output motor command modulation, thanks to synaptic plasticity. Therefore, a damage to cortical LTD rate results in impaired learning. Altered cortical LTD has been associated with human pathologies [7]; however, the main studies report data from animals, because it is difficult to isolate the contribution of single damages in patients. Therefore, a new tool to investigate pathological conditions is necessary, to fill the gap between animal and human studies and provide deeper insight into cerebellar diseases. A promising solution is to modify realistic computational models of human neural circuits and then embed them into closed-loop simulations to reproduce misbehaviours.\nIn the current study, we used this approach to investigate LTD rate damage in the cerebellum during EBC and VOR, showing the promising role of computational neuroscience in understanding pathologies.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nSimulations were performed through a realistic Spiking Neural Network (SNN) representing a cerebellar microcomplex, with physiological topology and connection ratios [1]. To simulate EBC and VOR, we provided two input signals (state information and noxious stimulus/error), which were coded by specific neural populations and depended on the protocol (Fig. 1). The output motor command produced a time-event (CR) when overcoming a threshold during EBC, while during VOR the signal drove continuously the eye motion.\nThe network included specific learning rules at three cortical and nuclear plasticity sites. The healthy model was able to achieve fast adaptation due to cortical plasticity and slow consolidation of motor capabilities thanks to nuclear plasticity [3]. The learning rule parameters were optimized through a Genetic Algorithm [8, 9].\nLTD rate damage was reproduced by decreasing the learning rule parameter regulating cortical LTD, from 10% to 70% of reduction.\nEach simulation consisted of 100 repetitions:\n•\tEBC: 10 blocks of 10 trials with 9 CS-US and 1 CS-alone repetitions; CS lasted 350 ms; US lasted 100 ms and co-terminated with CS.\n•\tVOR: in each trial, the target was fixed while the head was moving for 1 s according to a sinusoidal trajectory with amplitude 5° and frequency 1 Hz.\nTo evaluate the outcome, we computed the %CR on blocks of 10 trials for EBC and the Root Mean Square gaze Error (RMSE) for VOR; the gaze error was the difference between the desired and actual eye position movement.\n\nResults\nDuring EBC the main effect of LTD rate reduction was a delayed acquisition of motor performance (Fig. 2A). In fact, when decreasing LTD rate by 10% to 50%, the model achieved the same %CR as in healthy conditions during the late acquisition blocks, but learning was slower. However, in case of severe damage (70% decrease), conditioning did not occur: there was not a significant improvement of %CR throughout the trials, with maximum 10% CR. This case matched the results of experiments on mice with LTD rate damage, where the %CR did not significantly increase at the end of the protocol [7].\nDuring VOR simulations, for damages up to 50%, the RMSE decreased throughout the acquisition trials, by tuning the output motor command, without any significant delay in learning. In particular, for an intermediate damage, the RMSE decreased as fast as in healthy conditions but the residual value was higher (Fig. 2B). This result differs from the outcome of EBC simulations where conditioning occurred in late acquisition even for an intermediate damage. On the other hand, when LTD rate impairment was higher, the RMSE did not meaningfully decrease during the task, demonstrating that learning was completely compromised, like in EBC. This case reproduced the same lack of adaptation showed in mice during VOR in the reference study [4].\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe present study provides a successful example on the use of realistic models of brain areas to simulate pathologies. We evaluated the behavioural effects of a damage to cortical LTD during two different cerebellum-driven tasks. The model was able to reproduce the same lack of motor learning as in animal experiments; then, by associating low-level impairment and misbehavior, we could predict the damage amount in the reference studies. Moreover, we could achieve a deeper insight into the role of cortical LTD. In fact, the delayed conditioning during EBC simulations for damages up to 50% proved that this plasticity mechanism is fundamental for fast learning. However, in case of more complex tasks like VOR, cortical LTD is crucial not merely for a time association, but also for a continuous tuning in amplitude and phase of the output.\nFurther analysis on the low-level neural activity and synaptic weights would shed light on the underlying altered mechanisms. In particular, it could help testing compensatory mechanisms and suggesting possible treatments.\nThen, we could use the same approach to simulate different pathologies, involving damages to neural populations, such as silencing PCs to simulate cortical degeneration [10].\nFinally, the investigation of pathologies through a computational model could suggest new elements to be introduced in the model. This will increase the realism and the reliability of simulations, allowing to use the model as a clinical tool for faster diagnosis and treatment evaluation.",

        "text": "For Neuroinformatics the era of big data presents a number of challenges for systematizing the collection, transferal and processing of brain related data. Specifically for neuroimaging there are hurdles for registering high-resolution brain images (2D/3D or 4D) in a timely manner - a task that is important for normalizing between different imaging systems and to make comparative studies in a common space. Thus, time and space requirements mean that processing data on a single computer may not be possible.\n\nFor the Brain/MINDS project, which studies the brain of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), and at the Neuroinformatics Japan Center (NIJC), we have developed a data analysis platform that combines a high performance computer cluster (HPC) with a large-scale storage system (LSSS), running over a high-speed network. A virtual machine (VM) running Ubuntu, via VDI technology, provides seamless access to the HPC and LSSS. Users can therefore perform data analysis and processing on data sizes that would exceed the capabilities of their desktop computers.\n\nTo facilitate distributed computation we have developed a Python package called SPyKGD that uses Open Grid Scheduler/Grid Engine and makes it simple to submit jobs to the cluster computer. By using SPyKGD with the Jupyter Notebook web application users can easily create new workflows, save the state of their calculations within the notebook itself, and share them with other users.\n\nCurrently we are using this platform to process and register high-resolution multi-modal marmoset brain data (histology, MRI, etc.) to reconstruct the brain in 3D. To do this we launch a number of jobs on the cluster for image processing, linear, and non-linear image registration. We will describe the platform’s architecture, example workflows and registration results.",

        "text": "Introduction The successful reuse of data and the testing of an experiment’s reproducibility both rely on data that is well­described. The stored metadata must capture as much of the provenance as possible about how the data was acquired, processed, and analyzed. One critical aspect of the storing of provenance is employing commonly used terms and precise definitions. There are several lexicons and ontologies of brain imaging terms available to the neuroscience community, e.g., NeuroLex[1] and OntoNeuroLog [ref] that both follow the OBO[2] principle of providing definitions for terms. This is crucial for reducing ambiguity for potential users. In this abstract we report on efforts by the International Neuroscience Coordinating Facility's Standards for Data Sharing Workgroup to make available defined terms used in each stage of the data lifecycle of brain imaging research in service of the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM)[3]. Our efforts currently are focused on terms describing the acquisition of neuro­related data. We are currently constructing a data model (NIDM­Experiment) that includes a comprehensive collection of terms that encompass several imaging modalities, raw and processed imaging datasets and files that normally accompany such experiments. We include neuroimaging metadata terms from common data formats such as DICOM[4]. Methods Previous work has focused on the analysis of fMRI data, which has resulted in NIDM­Results[5], which now includes namespaces for three of the major processing packages SPM [6] and FSL [7] and AFNI [8] group. The goal in this part of the project is to provide libraries that will automatically generate provenance information for the derived data from each package. In the NIDM­Results case, differences in naming conventions, require that definitions are needed to clarify the meaning of terms common across packages. In the case of NIDM­Experiment, differences between vendors exist, e.g., the naming of pulse sequences and in the output data format (DICOM, p­file, PAR/REC). However, though the terms describing the experiment are, for the most part, not vendor specific, standard defined terms are still required due to potential ambiguity (“investigation”, “run”). Currently we are creating a parsimonious data model that will accommodate multiple modalities, but can be expanded to provide modality­specific terms (for MRI, MEG, electrophysiological measurements, PET, CT). This is made easier by the adoption of the DICOM standard for many MRI, PET, and CT systems and by emerging standards such as the Neurodata Without Borders[9] effort. We are currently using a GitHub­based system for discussing and defining terms and definitions. Once definitions have been codified they are referenced by URI in Terse RDF Triple Language (Turtle) documents and translated into a hierarchical Web Onotology Language (OWL) file. We are basing the terms and properties on Prov­O [10], but have adopted extant definitions where possible from existing ontologies. The data structures of SchizConnect [11] and TRANSFORM­DBS are being used to generate test queries against the data model. SchizConnect integrates multiple schizophrenia imaging data resources using a common interface, and must solve the challenge of clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging terminology differences across the constituent data sets. TRANSFORM­DBS [12] is a DARPA­sponsored multi­modality project designed to treat post­traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data will be made public along with a rich metadata complement. NIDM­Experiment will be used to describe metadata stored and made available in these two projects. Results NIDM­Experiment has been constructed to address terms necessary to describe neuro­based data acquisition and to include provenance explicitly. Derived data is currently addressed by NIDM­Results [5], which is available either from within the program (SPM 12) or by means of add­in scripts (FSL and AFNI). Each term has been defined using either a definition from an established ontology such as Prov­O, OBI, and the Dublin Core or with a community­constructed definitions. We are currently working to expand the initial set of terms chosen for NIDM­Experiment. Conclusions: We have created a sets of defined terms covering the acquisition and analysis of neuro­related data for as constituent parts in the INCF Neuroimaging Data Model. We are basing the models on the complexity real­world data sets and testing the models’ efficacy through queries against these data sets.",

Various scales of observations and analysis of neuronal structure have been performed to reveal neural morphology and connectivity in the brain. In this study, we present a protocol to evaluate neural morphological characteristics quantitatively based on reconstructions from confocal images. Our protocol combines software tools for image filtering and masking with reconstruction by our original software, SIGEN (Minemoto et al., 2009), which segments and extracts dendritic neural structure. The segmentation software extracts structure from confocal images automatically, and selects the largest continuous object as a main structure of reconstructed neuron. A problem for automated segmentation is the occurrence of fragments not connected to it. SIGEN accounts for this problem by connecting the fragments to the main structure based on two criteria, their volumes and distances to the main structure. Furthermore, spurious segments are removed and dendritic branches are smoothed by averaging. The reconstructed neurons are stored in the SWC format, so their morphological properties can be evaluated and compared by quantitative characterization tool, such as vaa3D (Peng et al., 2014). We applied our protocol to an interneuron in the honeybee brain for comparison of their morphological properties.",

        "text": "Techniques based on imaging serial sections of brain tissue provide insight into brain structure and function and the usage of complementary approaches is considered indispensable in characterizing the spatial organization of neuronal structures and their circuitry. However, to compare or combine them with results from three dimensional imaging methods, reconstruction into a volumetric form is required.\n\nTo perform such tasks in a streamlined way we introduce the Possum framework [1], software for reconstruction of three-dimensional images of the brain from series of two-dimensional images of stained sections. To develop the framework we reviewed and selected workflows which accomplish versatile reconstruction tasks according to today’s best practices. Additionally, we demonstrate properties of individual routines and illustrate which reconstruction task they are suitable for, and evaluate the efficiency of a subset of the algorithms implemented. We also validate the implementation using synthetic datasets and actual experimental imaging data derived from publicly available resources [2]. Finally, we present actual computational pipelines created using the framework [3,4].\n\nThe framework provides researchers with a possibility of building reconstruction workflows from existing components, without the need for low-level implementation. As a consequence, it also facilitates sharing and data exchange between researchers and laboratories.

        "text": "The complexity of workflows that span from the experimental recording of neuronal data up to the publication of final results of the analysis is increasing as datasets grow in size and analysis methods for massively parallel data sets become more intricate. The implementations of such internally designed workflows in various laboratories are highly heterogenous and far from being automatized. Software supporting such workflows is still largely under development or even missing. This situation leads to serious consequences regarding the degree of reproducibility of data capture and data analysis. Although the problem is well-known and leads to ineffective and unsustainable science, the development of guidelines and tools to facilitate a complete, provenance-tracked, and yet user-friendly workflow is an ongoing matter of research.\n\nHere, we sketch the primary challenges that complicate the design of workflows for electrophysiological research as we have witnessed them in our own work through collaborations with experimental groups. We outline how existing software tools can be combined and integrated to form partial workflows, and how such an approach is able to address some of the challenges (outlined in [1]). In particular, we practically demonstrate how a specific set of tools can be linked to a workflow with a standardized, yet flexible foundation, that builds on the specificities of the dataset, the analysis approach, and the available infrastructure (e.g., the available computational resources). We therefore identified and partly developed for this purpose three open-source tools that build the scaffold  for a basic workflow: metadata management (odML, [2,3]), data representation (Neo, [4]), and data analysis (Elephant [5]). On the basis of this concrete workflow implementation we discuss open questions and urgently needed software components to tackle the challenge of reproducibility in the analysis of electrophysiological data. In part, this work is described in [6].",

Using this map and VERTEX (the Virtual Electrode Recording Tool for EXtracellular potentials) we generated a three-dimensional multilayered network representative of an in vitro slice preparation. We wished to investigate the relationship between the synaptic connectivity described here and the dynamics one would record in vitro. So we simulated the neuronal dynamics and local field potential generated by this network after transient stimulation of layer 4 pyramidal cells and then compared this to the layer-specific local field potential and mulit-unit activity recorded in vitro as a result of electric field stimulation. This data was recorded using a multi electrode array from slices made hyper-excitable by perfusion with 4-amino-pyridine and stimulated in layer 4 using a bipolar electrode. Here we see a larger response in the deeper layers, in particular in the multi-unit activity. Through our model, we show the extent to which the synaptic connectivity contributes to this layer-specific response in the rat somatosensory cortex.",

        "text": "Mapping and understanding the blueprint of the wiring of the brain at the micro-, meso-, and macroscale level is a central theme in neuroscience. In order to understand the cortical connectivity organization of mammals, numerous studies have mapped the wiring of different cortical areas in species from different orders such as carnivora, rodentia, human and non-human primates. Qualitative observations in the macaque cortex suggest that the cytoarchitecture of cortical areas is closely related to fundamental connectional features like the existence of connections and their laminar patterns. Based on these observations, in a series of separate previous investigations we analyzed the mouse, cat, macaque monkey and human connectomes. These studies confirmed that cytoarchitectonic similarity, together with physical distance, constitutes a wiring principle with a potential mammalian-general scope.\n\tIn the current study we aimed at explicitly demonstrating this generalizability by using all available mammalian connectomes and predicting the macroscale connectome of one species from cytoarchitectonic features and physical distances from another species. This analysis also addressed if the generalization of the wiring principles depends on the phylogenetic proximity of the examined species. The results demonstrate successful cross-species predictions of the existence and laminar patterns of connections (for instance predicting laminar origin of connections in the cat cortex from cytoarchitectonic information on macaque monkey cortical areas), hence explicitly demonstrating the mammalian-general character of the cytoarchitecture-based wiring principle. Moreover, the effect of this principle does not seem to depend on the phylogenetic distance of the examined species. Lastly, the current approach allows the prediction of laminar patterns in humans at a whole-cortex level, information that can not be extracted by current in vivo imaging methods.\n\tIn sum, the structural connectivity skeleton of the mammalian brain, important for healthy brain functioning, appears to a large extent to be shaped based on a common blueprint, possibly due to evolutionary conserved neurodevelopmental mechanisms.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nA fundamental goal of organizing and annotating scientific data is to provide investigators with an effective mechanism to access and share data with the wider scientific community.  To attain these goals, the data needs to have both adequate descriptions to make it useable [1] and be represented in a structured form, accessible to computational tools.  The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM;http://nidm.nidash.org/ ) is an ongoing effort to represent, in a single data model, the different components of a research activity (e.g., participants, project information, derived data), their relations, and provenance [2].  NIDM has a modular design currently consisting of NIDM-Results, NIDM-Workflows, and NIDM-Experiment. NIDM-Workflows is focused on the description of data analysis pipelines and detailed software-specific variations. NIDM-Results is focused on the representation of mass-univariate neuroimaging results using a common descriptive standard across neuroimaging software packages.  NIDM-Experiment is focused on the representation of the experiment design, the source data collected during the experiment and information on the participants, including generic assessments, demographics, and visit information.  This abstract presents our prototyping work on representing assessments and metadata collected during the course of a typical neuroimaging experiment.\n\n\nMethods\n\nNIDM is developed using a community-driven process that engages stakeholders to participate in the identification of use-cases that drive development. In-person workshops and weekly video conferences are used to maintain communication while example NIDM documents, specifications, and software are developed by the INCF-NIDASH task force members.  NIDM is an  extension of the W3C recommended Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM ;www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/ ) for derived data and experiment descriptions in neuroimaging related fields.  NIDM Experiment captures details about an investigation (Figure 1). This pattern models metadata from neuroimaging data management systems at three levels: Investigation, Session, and Series. The Investigation level captures administrative information, while the Session and Series levels model assessments and MRI sessions.   The NIDM-Assessment object model (Figure 2) provides a generic model for describing the data dictionary and acquired assessment data.  Using the NIDM-Assessment model, an assessment “DataStructure” is composed of individual “DataElements” corresponding to the questions in the assessment.  When an assessment’s question contains multiple response choices, it is coded as a “ValueSet” in NIDM-Assessment and documents the answer choices and their coded values (Figure 3).  Data collected for a particular assessment are stored as acquisition objects of the assessment type described by the corresponding “DataStructure”. These objects are associated with an acquisition activity found at the Session or Series levels of the NIDM-Experiment model, depending on when the assessment was administered.  The NIDM-Assessment representations are serialized using the Terse RDF Triple Language (http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/) and queried using SPAQRL (https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/ ).\n\nResults\n\nThe NIDM-Experiment and NIDM-Assessment models are actively under development and currently being evaluated by mapping multiple datasets (e.g. FBIRN [3], OpenfMRI [4], NCANDA [5], etc.) into the structures.  Our examples are made available through the NIDM GitHub respository: https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidm.   The Conte Center on Brain Programming in Adolescent Vulnerabilities at the University of California, Irvine (http://contecenter.uci.edu) has made use of the early NIDM-Experiment related models in building its production informatics resource, which provides center investigators with inter-project data, including models for maternal and fetal heart rate, fetal movement, maternal blood oxygenations levels, derived DTI and fMRI measurements, and brain connectivity graphs.  Our initial experiments have shown the model to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of heterogenous data types.\n\nConclusions\nNIDM Experiment supports a variety of use cases focused on representing primary and derived data organization with the intent of simplifying data exchange, integration, and sharing. Our preliminary results indicate a modeling approach based on the W3C PROV-DM and NIDM is appropriate for modeling the heterogeneous data often collected in the course of a neuroimaging-related investigation and demonstrates the benefit of using semantic-web methods for data annotation.  Continued work will include finalizing the NIDM-Experiment model and creating applications to aid investigators in converting their existing data to the NIDM-Experiment representation, and using the representations in analysis tools and information management applications.",

        "text": "Mapping detailed connectivity and delineating brain regions by anatomical and functional profiles are crucial for understanding brain function. With the advent of novel imaging techniques and data analysis algorithms, connectivity-based approaches have shown to further divide previously defined topographical region into distinct subregions based on long-range connectivity patterns in cortex and other brain areas. We aim to map the connectivity-based subdivision of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), an area known to play a critical role in information processing within basal ganglia circuitry. Recently, STN has become the primary target of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatments of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, making it essential to understand detailed functional subregions within and topological patterns of inputs to STN. Still, partly because of its small size and previous difficulties in precisely delineating its structure, the functional and anatomical connectivity patterns of the STN circuitry require more study.\n\nPrevious works, based on functional activation pattern similarity of regions from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and tractography using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to find functional/structural connectivity patterns, were often limited to large cortical-region-driven approaches instead of full voxel-by-voxel analysis between brain regions. Moreover, because of the low resolution offered by these techniques, identified subdivisions were often relatively coarsely partitioned, making these techniques inapplicable to small brain regions.  On the other hand, fluorescent tracer injection studies can provide more precise cellular-level, anatomically accurate connectivity information that can be used for fine-grained parcellations of even very small brain areas. Also, it can easily be extended to study cell-type specific connection patterns, providing additional valuable information that can be used as criteria for more complex functional parcellation.\n\nDespite the ability to segment arbitrary regions into finer subdivisions, full voxel-by-voxel approaches are often hindered by inter-subject variability and lack of measurement data. Since the number of unknowns (number of voxels in region of interest) greatly exceed the number of available experiments, such an approach is generally considered intractable without accepting the hypothesis that the data can be well represented in low-rank subspace or by the use of appropriate constraints that not only efficiently narrow down the solution space but that also capture intrinsic biological properties of the data.\n\nMotivated by this, we focus on two challenging key tasks: (1) using fluorescent protein-expressing viral tracers for constrained full voxel-by-voxel structural connectivity analysis in external globus pallidus (GPe)-STN and cortico-subthalamic circuits; (2) using nonparametric clustering of connectivity patterns in a 3-D spatial map for fine-level subregion parcellation of both GPe and STN.\n\nWe apply a dictionary learning based Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm to find the sparse representation of axonal projection data with dictionary atoms that effectively capture biological properties. We then estimate a voxel-level connectivity matrix using multivariate sparse regression techniques with constraints that promote smooth and spatially coherent/localized projection patterns. Finally, we propose a non-parametric probabilistic connectivity-based clustering method that automatically estimates the number of subgroups and also imposes spatial contingencies within subregions.",

        "text": "In last decades, there has been enormous amount of upsurge in miscellaneous scientific publications (Hunter and Cohen, 2006). Most of the published scientific literature is available in Portable Document Format (PDF) files, as the combination of text in different styles (e.g. font, placement, alignment, colour, size etc.), figures in different formats (e.g. PNG, JPEG, TIFF etc.), tables and attached supplementary material (e.g. datasets, software tools, libraries etc.). Along with the significance of published text, the impact of scientific figures has been widely recognized. Millions of figures have been published so far, which includes the information about the varied results obtained from different scientific experiments e.g. PCR-ELISA data, Microarray analysis, Gel electrophoresis, Mass spectrometry data, DNA/RNA sequencing, diagnostic imaging CT/MRI, ultrasound scans etc., and medicinal imaging e.g. EEG, MEG, ECG, PET images etc., other anatomical and pathological images. Analysing published scientific figures can be very helpful in drawing significant hypotheses, exemplifying approaches and describing experimental results, establishing better understanding of different clinical and scientific problems.\nThe importance of Information Retrieval (IR) in the scientific community is well known, as it plays vital roles in analysing crucial published data. Today, one of the major challenges in IR is the implementation of a system, which can help in efficiently analysing published scientific literature (PDF files) by extracting, classifying and categorizing the valuable content. Unfortunately, PDF is only rich in displaying and printing manuscripts, and requires extensive efforts for the extraction of text and image based information. Several commercial and free downloadable, open source tools have been developed for the physical and logical document structure analysis of PDF files but were unable to extract and provide content (text and images) in the form where it could be considered for complex data analysis e.g. mining text in reading order from double or multiple columns documents, searching marginal text using key-words, removing irrelevant graphics and extracting embedded text inside single and multi-panel complex biological images etc.\nThe goal of our research is to implement a method, which can help in analysing published scientific literature by extracting text and figures from PDF. Furthermore, we aim to classify extracted text and mine embedded text inside figures to significantly moderate the search and IR capabilities. Meeting the technological objectives of our research, we have developed and present a user friendly, modular and client based system i.e. MSL (Ahmed et al., 2015), which supports the extraction of text and images by interpreting all kinds (single, double or multiple columns) of published PDF files (Figure 1A).\nMSL applies advanced data mining and image processing techniques by integrating different open source and commercial libraries (Figure 1B) for text and image extraction. It implements modular approach for the marginalization of extracted full text based on different coordinates, keywords and file attributes. It also provides features for the extraction of figures from PDF files and applies Optical Character Recognizer (OCR) to extract embedded text from all kinds of biomedical and biological Images. Moreover, for further data mining, it generates system’s output in different file formats including text (marginal information), XML (structured information), images (extracted figures) and PDF (analysed images using OCR).\nMSL is a desktop application, has been designed following the principles of Butterfly paradigm (Ahmed et al., 2014a; Ahmed and Zeeshan, 2014b) and developed in C# programming language. Most recent available version of MSL has been tested and validated in-house at different datasets (scientific publications from different publishers) e.g. Figure 1A (Ahmed et al., 2014c). MSL is very easy to install and use application (Figure 1C), which can only be configured at Microsoft Windows platform and supporting operating systems. MSL is freely available to download (https://zenodo.org/record/30941#.VuB_M7S5LHM) and use.",

        "text": "Symbolic dynamics (Rajagopalan et al. 2007)  in the context of EEG are highly interwoven with the notion of Lehmann's microstates (Lehmann et al. 1987, 2010). These are detectable in the multichannel signal, from both event-related and spontaneous activity recordings, as recurrent quasi-stable scalp potential maps lasting from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Discrete symbols can be assigned to these microstates, and since they are characterized by great consistency across subjects, this offers a very efficient data reduction method and further facilitates the derivation of brain dynamics descriptors (Ville et al. 2010; Dimitriadis et al., 2012). However, the whole approach relies on signal amplitude characteristics and, hence, ignores aspects of neural coordination that involves genuine interactions beyond coincidence in timing. Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of microstates, we have recently introduced an alternative representation that aims at analyzing functional-connectivity patterns (Dimitriadis et al. 2013, 2015). The relevant microstates, functional connectivity microstates (FCμstates), proved to be convenient descriptors for tracking inter-areal synchronization during cognitive ERP responses and revealed dynamical trends in a parsimonious fashion.\n\nWe increase the descriptive power of the FCμstates approach by integrating a non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) (Lee and Sung, 1999) algorithmic step. Here -for the first time- NNMF is applied to functional connectivity patterns, which are formed by inherently positively-valued measurements. The introduced approach starts by deriving time-indexed functional connectivity profiles based on pairwise, quasi-instantaneous, estimates of inter-areal phase synchronization. Time series of functional connectivity patterns are then formed (Lachaux et al. 1999). As a crucial step towards understanding the connectivity dynamics, non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) is employed for data learning purposes. The extracted basis vectors are used for the re-parameterization of the functional connectivity within a ‘‘reduced’’ space. They correspond to the most essential ingredients for a parsimonious, part-based, representation of the original connectivity patterns. Within this low-dimensional, re-parameterized space, symbolization (by means of vector-quantization) (Martinetz et al. 1993) is performed and associated with the semantics of the brain's network organization. This steps transforms the sequence of connectivity patterns into a time series of symbols. Each symbol represents a homogeneous class of patterns, or equivalently, a connectivity microstate (FCμstate). The study of emerging symbolic dynamics can mediate the understanding of network-organization dynamics, since descriptors like Markov-Chains can now be applied in order to model complex neurodynamics phenomena. The whole procedure can be applied in different ways depending on the scope of each study. For instance, a subject-specific ‘alphabet’ of prototypical connectivity patterns can be designed and used to compare different recording conditions based on the recurrence of FCμstates. Alternatively, by adopting a collective design strategy (across a large population of subjects), commonalities in a population can be deduced that will reflect universal functional connectivity (re)organization trends.\n\nThe proposed methodology was applied to multichannel EEG signals, to investigate how music influences the spatiotemporal network profile of ongoing brain activity. Brain activity at rest and during music listening was recorded from 14 volunteers. The favorite song of each participant and a 'neutral' piece of music, common among the participants, were employed to bring a subject's brain in two distinct states. Our design aimed at detecting music induced changes (by comparing resting state vs. music listening), providing indications about subject's engagement to music (by contrasting 'neutral' vs. 'favorite' music) and facilitating the detection of commonalities across subjects (by delivering a common music track). The included results point to the importance of particular brain rhythms in shaping connectivity during listening to music, the realization of distinctive functional-connectivity microstates (organization patterns) and the emergence of music-related metastability phenomena (Tognoli and Kelso, 2014). Based on class separability and statistical analysis of the symbolic time series, we identified two microstates the presence/absence of which signals the states of resting/musing-listening. Using the two mined prototypical connectivity patterns, we attempted a network characterization (Sporns, 2011)  of the most distinctive FCstates. The most important difference between these two microstates was detected in the spatial layout of the connectivity strength.",

        "text": "Data sharing is becoming more of a requirement as technologies mature, and global research and communication diversifies. As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access particular datasets. In many cases, acquisition realities present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and greater exploratory data mining.\n\nTo answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced the mission of Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens, 2016). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das et al., 2015) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of public data sharing, including:\n\n1)   Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (clinical, genomics, imaging, phenotypic, demographic, etc.)\n2)   Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring patient and subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers).\n3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented subject data.\n4)   Configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to High Performance Computing clusters for immediate processing.\n5)   Robust Quality Control mechanisms usable as covariates in analysis.\n6)   Long term storage (and web access) of data, resulting in little attrition (i.e. lost data).\n7) Enhanced web-based visualization of imaging, genomics, and phenotypic data, allowing for real-time viewing and manipulation of data from anywhere in the world.\n8) Mobile data access capabilities with responsive viewing.\n9) Numerous modules for data filtering, summary statistics, and personalized and configurable dashboards.\n\nThe goal of Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute will be a concerted undertaking that seeks to facilitate data sharing on a global scale. Our goal is to utilize the years of experience in multi-site collaborative research to implement the technical requirements to achieve this level of public data sharing in a practical, yet robust manner.",

Many research community software tools are widely adopted in every application area, from brain mapping to cellular neurophysiology to behavior and psychophysics. Often these tools have are authored by Neuroscience domain experts with limited formal training in computer science or software engineering. Because Neuroscience is complex and fast-changing, it is critical such domain experts lead and/or actively collaborate on scientific software tool development. MATLAB is a technical computing platform designed for ease-of-use and high productivity by scientific users. Recently introduced capabilities allow research-focused users to flexibly incorporate software engineering practices into their tool development process, including object-oriented programming, app development, interactive debugging, source code management, and unit testing. Many existing and new research community software tools have begun adopting these capabilities. Several have also begun using GitHub, a widely used web-based tool for code hosting and software project management. Projects hosted on GitHub are increasingly being cross-listed on File Exchange, which is becoming a comprehensive index of MATLAB-based community software tools for neuroscience researchers. Here we will introduce these research software engineering capabilities and the evolving role of File Exchange for sharing and finding community software tools; and present examples of how Neuroscience research software tools are benefitting from these developments.",

To examine expression patterns of a large number of transcripts, we have proposed an integrated analysis platform of expression maps and the co-expression networks, in which the maps are located in the node position of the network depicted with a force-based stochastic method2. In the maturation stages as well as the adult stage that we reported previously, distributions of the network edge numbers followed the power law and the networks were rich in functionally related genes. The networks represented anatomical areas of the function without adding any anatomical information. Here we show the analysis of consistent co-expression through the stages and the analysis of diverse expression changing along the maturation covering the whole brain anatomical context.",

        "text": "Detecting a spatial expression pattern of a gene is very important to understand gene functions. Recently, many types of transcriptome studies associated with spatial expression have been reported. However, integrating different types of reports is not easy because of its different modalities. In this report, we have developed a new scheme for estimating highly reliable spatial gene expression patterns by comparing in situ hybridization (ISH) images of the BrainTx DB (http://www.cdtdb.neuroinf.jp) [1] with the transcriptome tomography volume data of the ViBrism DB (http://vibrism.neuroinf.jp) [2]. Both of the databases has spatial gene expression information of mouse brain. ISH images have high resolution information, but they are only two dimensional. In contrast, tomography volume data have low resolution information, but they are three dimensional. Combining them would give us better estimation of the spatial gene expression patterns.\nOverview of our scheme is shown in Fig.1. \nFirst of all, we had to consider how to map ISH images into three dimensional coordinates to compare with tomography data. Therefore, we used Waxholm Space Atlas (WHS) [3] as a standard coordinates. We re-sliced WHS by sagittal plane as a reference section and register ISH images into each of the sections by using affine transformation from Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK). We used gradient descent optimizer and measured suitability of the each optimization to decide the position of the ISH image in the standard coordinates.\nSecond, we estimated gene expression level in each brain region by comparing the registered ISH image with the segmentation information of the selected section in WHS. In this case, color information of the ISH image was useful to divide into signals and backgrounds. We used the equation (Blue * 2.0 – Red - Green) for enhancing signals. By these efforts, we could estimate and visualize a gene expression pattern of each gene in three dimensional coordinates (Fig. 2).\nThird, we parallelized our method to apply to a large number of ISH images. The registration process takes very long time. We estimated the calculation time of applying our method to all 3,000 ISH images in BrainTX DB, it takes over 2 month with single computer (Intel Xeon E5410). Therefore, we parallelized the method by using map method from ipython (jupyter) parallel package. Ipython engines in each calculation node were executed by Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and received different ID of ISH image. We were able to finish 3,000 registrations in 1.2 days with “plato” PC cluster (which has 32 Intel Xeon CPUs) operated by INCF J-node / RIKEN NIJC (Neuroinformatics Japan Center). This result was 60 times faster than single processor execution.\nFinally, we compared the registered ISH images with the tomography data about gene expression patterns. For the purpose, we chose 10 genes which were easy to recognize expressed regions visually in ISH images. In this case, almost 90 % of the regions recognized visually were covered by both of the registered ISH images and the tomography data. Not only that, we could also detect some expression regions that were difficult to recognize visually (Fig. 3).\nIn summary, we developed the automatic integration method about spatial gene expression databases and applied it to a large number of genes. However, we also found that this method depended on the condition of the ISH images. We need to find a better way to enhance ISH signals to improve the accuracy of the registration.\"\n",

        "text": "Transposase-accessible chromatin is of importance to better understand gene regulation and chromatin biology. Modern methods include assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), a new protocol to capture open chromatin sites (Buenrostro et al., 2013) by performing adaptor ligation and fragmentation of open chromatin regions (Tsompana and Buck, 2014). ATAC-seq helps in understanding the individual nucleosomes positions and chromatin compaction at high resolution by tagging sequencing adaptors at cleaved DNA sites of low starting cell number (500–50,000) into vitro (Buenrostro et al., 2013). ATAC-seq is based on high throughout sequencing and purified Tn5 transposase to estimate quantitative genetic interactions and probe open chromatin sites.\nDue to its efficiency in requirement of biological sample and in library preparation time, many scientists are generating ATAC-seq libraries to decipher the chromatin landscape of DNA in a given cell type and condition of interest. Bioinformatics is playing vital role in ATAC-seq data pre-processing and analysis in determining proportionally accessible regions of the genome with transposase activity and separating the reads shorter than canonical length (38bp) with positional information of nucleosome and its free regions (Buenrostro et al., 2015). ATAC-seq data processing pipeline starts with the quality check and adapter trimming, then alignment, shifting, removing duplicates, sorting and peak calling is performed to find significant numbers of mapped reads, indicating the presence of gene regulatory region. Implementation of ATAC-seq data processing pipeline is a complex task, as it involves the I/O (input/output) redirectional integration of several non-interactive command-line applications in Unix, Linux and DOS environments, which requires good knowledge of bioinformatics tools and good programming skills. Currently, there is no open source interactive software available, which can support biologists (without programming background) in doing ATAC-seq data processing.\nHere, we present I-ATAC as the first interactive, cross platform, user-friendly desktop application, which supports transparent, reproducible and automatic generation of ATAC-seq data processing. I-ATAC integrates several non-interactive mode applications for quality checking, adapter trimming, alignment, shifting, removing duplicates, sorting and peak calling by automatically generating and running sequential, multiple-parallel and customized data analysis pipelines. Its performance has been tested and delivered direct results on a private and public large-scale datasets which can be visualized using available genome browsers, for differential expression analysis to find significant numbers of mapped reads, indicating the presence of gene regulatory region in the genome.\nThe targeted end users of I-ATAC are mainly the biologists, who are used to of interactive operating systems (e.g. Windows, Mac-OS-X) and have no programming experience in command-line environment. I-ATAC is a user-friendly desktop application, based on the fundamental software engineering principles, Butterfly paradigm (Ahmed et al., 2014) human computer interaction guidelines and big data analytics. It is programmed in Java and requires Java Runtime Environment to be installed on in-use operating system (e.g. Windows, MacOSX etc.). Additionally, it compels all integrated applications to be downloaded and installed in data cluster and referenced genome for mapping. I-ATAC is very easy to install, cross platform application, freely available to download (https://zenodo.org/record/46078#.VsJIpLS5LHM) and use.",

The neuronal architecture and layering of the cortex is bound to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, for instance expression of genes, patterns of afferents connections and functional activity. Numerous studies have identified genes that appear to be essential for the generation and laminar positioning of different types of neurons in the mouse cortex by using gene knock out or silencing methods. Such studies have the benefit of being causal but the number of genes that can be knocked out or silenced is limited. Moreover, knocking out  certain genes may prove to be lethal and thus render the observation of the effects in the cellular organization of the adult brain impossible. Despite a plethora of existing studies, the information that gene expression paterns carry on the structural traits of the cortical areas has not yet been quantified at the whole cortex level. In other words, the extend to which gene expression patterns can predict for example the number of neurons of a cortical area has not been explicitly demonstrated.\n\tHere we combine the Allen Brain Atlas data (detailed gene-expression mapping of thousands of genes across the brain of the C57Bl/6J mouse) with previously published data on the cellular and structural composition of the mouse cortical aras derived from the application of the isotropic fractionator. In total ~4000 genes and 6 structural traits (number of neurons, number of non-neuronal cells, density of neurons, cortical type, thickness and volume) from 38 cortical areas were examined. The two multidimensional datasets (transriptome and structural traits) were associated with partial least squares regression combined with a recursive feature elimination algorithm. This technique allows harvesting the most predictive set of genes that maximally predict the various structural traits of the cortical areas. The transcriptome-based model was tested against three benchmark models. One incorporating only the spatial relations of the cortical areas, one using the patterns of thalamic afferents and one that uses the patterns of patterns of cortical afferents. Co-expression analysis was also conducted for the set of the maximally predictive genes to investigate their potential synergistic role.\n\tOur results indicate that the transciptional signature of an area is highly predictive of its various structural traits, explaining from ~60% up to ~90% of the variance of the structural traits from only a small set (<~2%) of the total genes. The transcriptome-based model not only performed above chance but also outperformed in a statistically significant way all the benchmark models (distance-based, thalamic afferents-based, and cortical afferents-based), thus demonstrating that simple spatial proximity or patterns of afferents from thalamic and cortical regions do not explain better the distinctive structural features of cortical areas. Our findings indicate that to a great extent the structural features of a cortical area are encoded in a very small set of co-expressed genes that might be instrumental for the development and eulamination of the cortical sheet.",

PHML offers integrative simulation involving encapsulated components of biomechanical models and modeling tools and databases were well developed [2], and recently available for neuroinformatics databases, which are inevitable to treat complexity and multiscale properties. In data construction and categorization, designing of the common metadata format is a hot topic and ontology is an effective solution on the issue. We have discussed on the framework “In-Silico Modeling Ontology (ISMO)” [3] to apply J-Node platforms (PF) for cross communications of different PFs. The fundamental framework was proposed and the system was successfully demonstrated as Ontology-Based Search Server (ObSS) [4]. The latest version of ObSS was limited to applications of modeling database; however, in the present study, we extends the concept to the general neuroinformatics contents in PFs, which enhances the availability for a user who is unfamiliar to the target PF data index by listing relevant ontology keywords depending on the context of what the user is interested in.\n\nThe proposed ObSS conforms user’s input message to assigned keywords in multiple ontologies and then lists visually a limited ontological structure, which was estimated to fit for the user’s interest. This method may contribute to data content visualization using 3D atlas, which is also an important topic of cooperative J-Node platform projects.",

In the economics of science, data and methods should be maximally reusable in order to maximize the scientific return on the data acquisition investment and results should be reliable in order to build solutions and develop new research directions.\n\nApproach\nOur approach is divided into three technology development efforts and a training mission. 1) Resource Discovery: In this project, we will develop new search and discovery tools to create a sophisticated, comprehensive and dynamic search environment for working with distributed neuroimaging data, tools, workflows and execution environments. These tools will integrate and extend existing successful community platforms, data, and search services. This work will specifically support the end user with a specific analytic goal to find the appropriate data and analysis workflows that can subsequently executed on local or cloud-based executions environments. 2) Data Modeling and Interoperability: The primary aims of this project will be to provide a consistent and extensible data model for communicating information in brain imaging and associated easy to use, supported, and documented software libraries and services  for developers. Using these models, we will provide end users a set of commonly used reproducible workflows with integrated provenance tracking that are easy to use. The workflows will be validated and ideally be executable on infrastructure available to researchers. The workflows will generate queryable results using standardized data models that are essential to allow software and people to communicate and interpret data precisely. 3) Reusable Execution Environments: The goal of this project is to enable reproducible computation through full automation and tracking of computing environments. The result will be a NeuroImaging Computation Environments MANager (NICEMAN). NICEMAN will support easy and reproducible execution of neuroimaging analysis workflows on various computational platforms, while efficiently reusing and integrating existing free and open-source software products and data sharing initiatives. Execution of workflows will be achieved by automatically creating computation environments where necessary and making sure software and datasets are available, executing the workflow(s), and providing results and detailed provenance information about the environment back. 4) Training: Our objectives are to provide the brain imaging community with online training materials based on the concepts and software developed by the center. We will conduct training workshops to teach the fundamentals of reproducible neuroimaging and to use center resources and tools effectively. In particular, we aim at providing researchers and clinicians with the know-how to integrate a full cycle of research: hypothesis testing, data and software discovery, finding and adapting “playbooks” or pipelines, allowing provenance tracking and results discovery, and reproducible computations. This training will cultivate a clear understanding of the concepts, assumptions, and limitations underlying the reproducible research automation tools.\n\nConclusion\nTogether, these technologies support a vision of a neuroimaging research landscape where the generation of knowledge is accomplished in a reproducible fashion (in terms of data, analysis, and computation) coupled with the ability to discover, reuse, and extend these studies by others in the community.",

        "text": "The CARMEN portal (developed under a UK EPSRC grant from 2006, and under a UK BBSRC grant until 2015) launched in 2008 (https://portal.carmen.org.uk). It allows researchers to store and share electrophysiology datasets and analysis tools, with a sophisticated security system, enabling researchers to collaborate and share datasets and tools. It was intended as a place where researchers could work collaboratively on data as though the analysis and modelling software, and the datasets were local to the researchers.\n\nConsiderable effort was put into developing the metadata system [1] and the internal data format, Neurophysiology Data Translation Format (NDF) [2]. Metadata is critical for allowing re-use of datasets and tools. Nonetheless, users report that inputting metadata discourages them from uploading data. This problem has two aspects. Firstly, neurophysiology metadata is complex and multi-faceted, starting from the relatively simple structural metadata (about the detailed file format) and ranging through more complex issues (e.g. the type and precise geometrical arrangement of electrodes and the detailed description of the neural tissue being recorded from) to even more difficult descriptions of the stimuli being used while recordings are being made (if they are from a live animal). Secondly, neurophysiologists do record this information, but often in a physical lab book. Uploading it feels like duplication of effort, and this is made worse because of the constraints imposed by the (generally) form-based input system for metadata failing to match the text in the lab book. The obvious solution to this is the use of an electronic lab book, so that the data is only entered once, but here too, standardisation is critical, particularly for extracting metadata.\n\nBecause most electrophysiology research is performed on equipment manufactured by a number of companies, and because they do not agree on standard formats, there are many different data formats for electrophysiology. Making analysis tools work across the plethora of formats for electrophysiology datasets entails an internal data format: this is critical, because the analysis and visualisation tools need to be able to interpret data without having to interrogate the format first. Services were provided to translate user data into this format. However, the format used [2] was designed at a time when overall formats were still changing. For example, HDF5 was not used, unlike the more recent formats proposed by Teeters et al [3] in their recent Neuroscience Without Borders project paper.\n\nMuch CARMEN usage has been by groups collaborating geographically: the security system allows sharing datasets and analysis tools with a high degree of granularity. These users have made little use of workflow technology. However, this may be because there were problems in providing workflow capability. The capability now provided includes a graphical editor, but this does not permit loops in the workflow, seriously reducing its usefulness (for example, it does not currently support applying a workflow over a range of parameters). This is an example of ease of use taking precedence over usefulness: the intended users were thought not to be programmers, so a visual interface for building workflows was provided. However, it is very difficult to provide the range of capabilities in a visual programming system that can be provided by a textual system – and this can be seen in the rarity of visual programming languages for general-purpose programming. In particular, providing loops and if-branches that allow for alteration of parameters is much easier in a scripting language. The unintended effect was to make sophisticated use of the workflow facility essentially impossible.\n\nThe recently released integrated capability to eyeball datasets has been useful, more so than the original tool used for data visualisation, which required the use of a separate program. This is an example of how developments in the technology alter the way in which one writes systems: in this case, the inclusion in HTML5 of an integrated (and cross-browser) capability for graph drawing changed the way in which graphics was best presented.\n\nRetinal neurophysiologists have been the most effective users of the CARMEN collaboratory.  A cross-animal study of excised retinal development has re-used data from different animals, using workflows to perform identical analysis on the raw data from different experiments: all the data and tools are publicly available [4].\n\nAspects of CARMEN’s implementation are now out-of-date. As noted earlier, a new internal data format would use HDF5, and the more recent attempts at standardisation. Issues of storing metadata have not been entirely solved, although there is more recent work on metadata [5]. However, the issue of ensuring single entry metadata is not yet solved. On the more technical side, services currently run on single cores, and much of the client-side was coded as Java applets (for example, data uploading). A new implementation would change these early decisions.\n\nVery recently, a new collaboratory system has been unveiled by the Human Brain Project [6]. This has come from a large project, and covers much more than neurophysiology. It includes much of what CARMEN attempted in its SP5 Neuroinformatics Platform. The release to non-members of HBP is very recent, and as yet no comparisons have been made. It is, however, clear that the collaboratory concept remains very much alive, but that the technology to support it has moved on considerably since the CARMEN project was implemented.",

        "text": "Introduction\nLarge-scale neural models (LSNMs) can relate neuroscience data from different temporal and spatial scales to investigate the neurocomputational mechanisms responsible for carrying out cognitive tasks. The availability of structural connectivity maps of the whole brain (i.e., connectomes) offers an opportunity to incorporate this macro-scale level information into LSNMs. In this work, we demonstrate how to merge LSNMs with a connectome to simulate multi-subject auditory and visual short-term memory neuroimaging experiments.\n\nMethods\nThe original visual and auditory short-term memory models (Tagamets and Horwitz, 1998, Husain et al, 2004; Horwitz et al., 2005) were composed of interconnected neural populations that represent, in the visual model, primary and secondary visual (V1/V2, V4), inferotemporal (IT), and prefrontal cortex (PFC), and in the auditory model, primary and secondary auditory cortices (A1, A2), superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (ST), and PFC. Half the neural populations within both LSNMs were 'non task-specific’ (NS) neurons (Horwitz et al, 2005) that provided noise to ‘task-specific’ neurons that dealt with either shapes (visual model) or tonal patterns (auditory model) during delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. In the current version, the NS neurons were replaced with an anatomical connectome model that contained 998 regions of interest (ROI) interconnected by white matter fiber tract weights (Hagmann et al., 2008) obtained from The Virtual Brain open-source software (TVB, Sanz-Leon et al, 2013). We devised an automated procedure to generate bidirectional links between visual and auditory LSNM nodes and TVB connectome nodes. To compare the simulations with actual neuroimaging experiments, we varied the weights among LSNM brain regions to generate different  “subjects” and we converted the simulated neural activity into neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG) time-series.\n\nResults and conclusions\nWe simulated multi-subject auditory and visual short-term memory neuroimaging experiments using the newly combined LSNM/TVB model. The TVB connectome provided neural noise to the neural activities of task-specific neuronal populations of the visual and auditory LSNMs.  The LSNMs, in turn, incorporated extra connectivity into the connectome, which is a refinement of the anatomical connectivity provided by white-matter fiber tract connections and are necessary for a computational model to perform a cognitive task. Our work shows how to merge LSNMs with structural connectomes to simulate multi-subject neuroimaging experiments of cognitive tasks.",

Such networks are called neuronal cultures while a single synchronization event is called a network spike (NS) or a population burst.\n\nThe stationary regime of a NS activity in neuronal cultures is thought to be related to epilepsy therefore both the origin and the properties of such a regime is a subject of intensive studies.\n\nIn a recent article [2] it was shown experimentally that spatial dynamics of a typical NS is inhomogeneous: there exist a few occasional local sources, or nucleation centers, from which the synchronous spiking activity propagates in the neuronal culture as traveling waves. The number and spatial locations of such sources are unique and steady for the specified culture of excitatory neurons, and these quantities vary over the different cultures.\n\nBy generalizing the NS simulation model [3] to the case of a spatially-dependent network topology, we show that nucleation centers of a NS occur in simulations at certain conditions. In particular, it is shown that (i) spatial nucleation centers of a network spike appear if the majority of connections between neurons are the local ones, (ii) nucleation centers are not nested in fluctuations of spatial density of neurons, (iii) inhibitory neurons (a) decrease the average frequency of NS occurrence, (b) increase the NS amplitude variability, the NS duration and the number of nucleation centers, (c) do not affect essentially the degree (i.e., coefficient of variation) of periodicity of NSs and the level of spiking activity between the subsequent NSs.",

        "text": "[Background and purpose]\nFunctional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a brain imaging facility and is widely used recently.  The brain functional activation is determined by measuring blood flow changes.  The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is one of the approaches to analyze brain functional activations [1][2].  This method is also used in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analysis.  In the GLM, activation is determined by the similarity of regression analysis between a basis function and a test data.  The basis function is generated by convolving the variable Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) with a boxcar function [3] and generally temporal variables are used for these parameters.  HRF has several parameters such as first peak delay, second peak delay and ratio of first and second peaks.  The boxcar function is related to the experiment design event and weights of boxcar function are uniform.  However, we assume parameters of HRF at each signal point are different and weights of boxcar function are also different [3][4].   Thus, in this paper, we apply adaptive HRF and adaptive boxcar function approaches.\n\n[Proposed method]\nThe parameters of HRF and weights of boxcar functions are derived by minimizing the difference between base function and experiment data.  This operation is performed for all the channels of all subjects.  Therefore, the optimum parameters of HRF and weights of boxcar functions are determined at every channel for every subject.  The object function is the t-value which is derived using the regression coefficient beta and residual error e.  To maximize the t-value, three parameters of HRF and weights of boxcar function are determined.\n\n[Method]\nThe proposed method is applied to N-back task experiment.  Then the effectiveness  of the proposed method is discussed.",

        "text": "Introduction: Core symptoms of patients with Lewy body dementia are fluctuations in cognition with marked attentional dysfunction. However the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these are insufficiently understood, which impedes the development of specific therapeutic strategies. As neurodegenerative disorders are not only impairments of discrete brain areas, but can also be seen as disorders of brain networks or disconnection syndromes (Morrison et al., 1986), we aimed to investigate underlying network dysfunctions during attentional processing in Lewy body dementia and compare these with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy controls.\n\nMethods: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine functional connectivity in 30 patients with Lewy body dementia, 20 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and 21 age-matched healthy controls during an event-related attentional task. All subjects performed a modified version of the Attention Network Test (Fan et al., 2002), where they were instructed to press a button in response to the majority direction of arrows that were either directed all in the same direction (congruent) or with one arrow pointing in the opposite direction (incongruent).\nAfter preprocessing, network activations were extracted by an Independent Component Analysis, fMRI data were temporally concatenated across all participant groups and common activations were derived with FSL-MELODIC (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC), which inferred 37 networks. We visually selected five networks (executive network, ventral and dorsal attentional network, default mode network) for further analysis. Then we extracted subject-specific time-series of each network of interest using FSL’s dual regression tool (Beckmann et al., 2009). Separate GLMs were performed for the time-course for each subject and network with each individual event as a separate regressor. The resulting beta estimates were grouped as beta series and correlated between the networks to derive information about functional network  interaction (Rissman et al., 2004). We compared the resulting covariance matrices between groups, using FSLNETs (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLNets) and custom Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts) scripts.\n\nResults: Our study revealed that functional connectivity of ventral and dorsal attention networks was reduced in patients with Lewy body dementia compared to patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy controls during all conditions, although most prominently during incongruent trials. On the contrary, Alzheimer’s disease was dominated by hyperconnectivity between the posterior part of the default mode network and the dorsal attention network in all conditions, particularly during incongruent trials.\n\nDiscussion: We suggest that the reduced connectivity in Lewy body dementia is mainly driven by a failure of bottom-up ventral attention networks, which leads to an over-reliance on the top-down dorsal attention network. The observed hyperconnectivity in Alzheimer’s disease might be either a compensatory effect to surmount default mode network dysfunction (Firbank et al., 2016) or a sign of the disturbed transition of the default mode network from rest to task.\n\nOur study shows dementia syndromes can consist of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity of distinct brain networks, contingent upon on the respective cognitive demand and available neural resources. Due to different underlying pathologies, these functional connectivity changes differ between Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and this might be of relevance for focussed cognitive therapies.",

        "text": "Introduction\nAdministration of sedation is a common practice in most of the clinical and/or surgical interventions, especially in critical care environment. Although it is necessary to relieve critically ill patients from unpleasant physical and psychological experiences, continuous assessment of sedation is highly crucial as improper sedation practice may lead to serious complications such as delirium. To deal with these concerns, bio-markers for sedative-induced unconsciousness must be manifested through objective brain signal analyses. A balanced amalgamation of cortical integration and differentiation has been proposed by several theoretical developments in the field of consciousness, which involve substantial variations in information transfer networks across multiple scales (Tononi, 2004). These findings motivate further research to correlate these variations with altered states of consciousness and quantify them. In this work, Partial Granger Causality (PGC) (Guo et al., 2008) has been utilised to assess the effect of sedation on the Fronto-Centro-Parietal cortical network.\n\nMethod\nAn effective connectivity analysis has been performed on a 128-channel EEG dataset involving Seven healthy subjects under three distinct levels of sedation (Awake, Mild, and Moderate) (Chennu et al., 2016). The study has been restricted to artefact cleaned and bandpassed EEG data (8-12 Hz) of eight scalp electrodes (FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, and P4) covering the related brain areas. Levinson-Robinson-Wiggins (LWR) algorithm has been implemented for estimating Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) model coefficients over multiple 500 ms data segments. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Durbin-Watson whiteness test have been used to evaluate the optimal model order and validate the model consistency, respectively. Furthermore, to remove the statistical biasness, permutation resampling test was used with a window size of 75 sample points and 20 permutations. The inference was done through statistical comparison (p<0.05, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons) of each causal interaction and PGC node strength among the three conditions. In our previous work, this methodology has been implemented for estimation of effective connectivity during distinct motor-imagery tasks (Rathee et al., 2016).\n\nResults\nThe results analysis presented a statistically significant decrease in strength of the effective connectivity features and node strengths at various electrodes as the level of sedation increases from awake to moderate level. These findings are consistent with previous study (Boly et al., 2013), which involved functional connectivity analysis at source level networks. Fig.1 depicts the mean PGC (across subjects) matrices while Fig.2 displays head plots of mean node strength (across subjects) for all the three conditions. Pairwise comparisons shown in Fig. 3 revealed maximum statistically significant directional connectivity indices and node strengths changes in Awake-Moderate pair. Mild-moderate comparison provided four significant node strengths and six connectivity indices changes while least significant features (two node strengths and four connectivities) changes were observed in Awake-Mild comparison.\n\nConclusion\nThis study showed that scalp-level directed connectivity analysis can be implemented to distinguish between altered states of consciousness using a small number of electrodes and therefore reducing the computational cost and analysis time. Moreover, the Fronto-Centro-Parietal Network exhibits strong variations in the node strengths and it could be exploited for real-time monitoring of consciousness in a clinical setting.\n\nFigure 1.

        "text": "Introduction and Motivations. Functional magnetic resonance methods detect in vivo brain hemodynamic responses related to specific task. After defined statistical processes pipeline, relevant information contained in the fMRI Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent signals are transformed in a 3D Statistical Parametric Maps. In our previous works, we investigated how to conveniently summarize these original 3D distributions by a more compact description composed of a set of indexes calculated for each functional area. These values, properly named Activation Weighted Indexes (AWIs), vary between 0 and 1 and regard all brain regions contained into specific template used for co-registration (e.g. using Juelich standard there will be 121 indexes). The proposed AWI based feature extraction procedure reduces the three-dimensions SPM distribution to the one-dimension AWI distribution The resulting quantized data structure of task-related brain activations, that we named Activation Weighted Vector (AWV), is a histogram, where each bin represents the level of the functionality of each brain structure. The expressiveness of AWV depends by the normalization procedure for fMRI scans: the more regions standard atlas has, the more AWIs are computable.  Proceeding from these considerations, we addressed the problem of generating an inclusive template for AWI analysis satisfying the right trade-off between exhaustion power and visual usability.\"\"\"\"Description of CRAIIM Hybrid Atlas. The hybrid atlas is the outcome of the joint operation between different brain templates found into the FMRIB Software Library. They are Juelich histological atlas and Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases. Both are probabilistic labelled and registered in MNI152 space. Juelich model was created by averaging multi-subject post-mortem cyto and myelo-architectonic segmentations, which has detected 52 grey matter structures and 10 white matters ones. Harvard-Oxford models cover 48 cortical and 21 subcortical structural regions, computed by segmentation of T1-weighted images of healthy male and female.  The joint process was possible choosing a reference atlas and then adding lacking anatomical structures. In our case, Juelich atlas was the template from which regions dearth were easily included choosing them from Harvard-Oxford atlases. This procedure, shaped with complete or partial union operations, gives rise to an hybrid atlas that covers 161 regions, in which 121 are the 100% of Juelich, and other 40 are a variable percentage of Harvard-Oxford original brain volumes. The benefits of this hybrid atlas are the integration of fundamental neuroanatomy models useful for co-registration that in the standard template were absent, e.g. many frontal and temporal cortexes, subcallosal portions, cingulate gyrus and thalamus halves. The limitation is that these last regions are in some cases a minor proportion of the Harvard-Oxford template. The hybridized atlas is in NIFTI format and its FSL-like name is CRAIIM-thr0-1mm.nii.gz (where thr0 is a voxel probability threshold, i.e. Prob. ≥ 0 to belong a certain anatomical label; and 1mm means the voxels resolution).    \"\"\"\"Clinical Applications. As above described, CRAIIM hybrid atlas has 161 regions. With this registration template, the AWV procedure generates vectors of 161 indexes from each SPMs yielding important advantages both in the analysis of collection of data and in the individual data interpretation.  The data represented in a “well dimensioned” vector space are used to perform efficiently quantitative measures of dissimilarity among brains functional activations basing on a given selected metrics. Unsupervised learning methods are naturally applied to learn the structure of the data and then to discover and recognize salient neurological patterns that unearth hidden features, also permitting their interpretation like individual brain signatures. With AWV analysis, the Radiologists investigate activation about macro categories alike white/grey matters contribution or left/right hemispheres functional balancement. In addition, AWVs allow physician to examine geographically defined zones such as frontal or temporal cortexes, motor or visual systems, limbic core, callosum commissure, or more detailed contribution akin Broca’s areas, Wernicke’s areas, &c. AWVs also facilitate severe assessment modalities for patients monitoring. For example, within homogenous group, clinicians could discover interesting level differences; or between heterogeneous ones, they   could observe interesting likeness. In addition, including time factor for each subject, longitudinal studies based on AWV could highlight brain plasticity processes more suitable than classical SPM qualitative visual inspection. These kind of clinical evaluations have claim among pre/post neurosurgical operation controls or during long-term ordinary patients’ checks. Obviously, AWV analysis is a math tool well applicable with active paradigm as well as passive ones, e.g. for resting state fMRI acquisition, keeping in mind the greater role that could have distributed functional connectivity instead locally defined expected activation. \"\"\"\"Present and Future Works. Hybrid atlas has enhanced activated weighted vector analysis thanks to its peculiarities. It has clinical utility for AWV methodology, but some kind of incompleteness for all brain region representation: it is missing of special structure like cerebellum and, in general, has some portion that is a percentage of its original atlases. Other own quality regards the resolution about only 1mm.  Future work is planned to generalize the atlas building procedure with which to easily generate solutions for diversified functional neuroradiological applications honouring the salience of existing specialized template.",

        "text": "We spend daily life by using a storage system called working memory. Working memory (WM) has been defined as a system for the temporary holding and manipulation of the information [1 - 2]. It plays an important role in cognitive functions such as language recognition and reasoning ability. A limited memory buffer of retaining and processing the information is called as working memory capacity (WMC), and it is different between individuals. The individual differences in WMC affect a variety of cognitive activities. For example, poor WMC is said to be related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and working memory training to make WMC increased is used as treatment for ADHD patients [3]. Working memory is used in the case of reading and solving mental arithmetic. Reading span test and N-back task are often used as an assessment of WMC. However, these paradigms are far from our daily life. Therefore, in this study, we adopted mental arithmetic task often used in everyday life. In a complex system such as working memory, each brain region does not always activate individually but often works cooperatively with other regions. Although the brain regions associated with working memory during mental arithmetic task had been revealed [4], cooperative relationship among these regions have not been investigated enough. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the cooperative relationship among the brain regions during mental arithmetic task using a functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) study.\n\n\nFourteen healthy adults (average age: 22.5 ± 1.5 years, 13 right-handed, 11 male) participated in this study. Participants performed the mental arithmetic task, which was consisted of the easy (non-working memory) and difficult (working memory) task, in the fMRI scanner. We calculated the correlation matrix and analyzed the functional connectivity. Acquired images were preprocessed by SPM8, and the activated regions were extracted and analyzed. A functional connectivity matrix of the individual data was calculated using Conn toolbox [5]. Each image was partitioned into 116 regions using automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas, and ROI-to-ROI connectivity was calculated for 116 regions. Moreover, graph theory metrics (degree and clustering coefficient) were calculated for each functional connectivity matrix using Brain Connectivity Toolbox [6]. Degree is the number of edges connected to other nodes and indicates the centrality of a certain node (the brain region). Clustering coefficient indicates the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together. Moreover, the community of the brain network is extracted using Newman algorithm, which is a graph partitioning method for network analysis. These metrics allow us to quantitatively analyze the structure of brain network.\n\n\nAverage correct answers of easy and difficult tasks were 30.7±4.9% and 3.88±1.17%, respectively, and it was confirmed that the answers of easy task were significantly higher than those of difficult task (t (13) = 22.5, p < 0.01). By group analysis we performed a paired t-test to examine the difference of activation between easy task and difficult task. Supplementary motor area and middle temporal gyrus were extracted as the regions whose activations were significantly higher for difficult task than for easy task. Significant activated regions during the difficult task were both cuneus and left precuneus. Since these regions are associated with working memory [7 - 9], they activated during the difficult task.Moreover, degree measures of these regions were significantly higher for difficult task than for easy task (paird t-test, p < 0.05). This suggested that these regions worked cooperatively with other regions during the difficult task compared with during the easy task. On the other hand, the clustering coefficient is higher for difficult task than for easy task for all regions (p < 0.05). This indicated that brain regions tended to form a cluster during the difficult task.Furthermore, 116 brain regions were partitioned into four communities, the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe and the occipital lobe in easy task. In difficult task, the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe were categorized into the same group, so that three communities were identified. These results suggested that the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe needed to work together during working memory task.In addition, observation of the regions connected from the both cuneus revealed that there were connections from the both cuneus to the frontal lobe (left middle frontal gyrus) and the parietal lobe (left inferior parietal lobule, left paracentral lobule) during difficult task. The frontal-parietal network is associated with visual attention, and controls the occipital visual cortex to selectively process only the required visual information [10]. Since our results found connections between the both cuneus and the frontal and parietal lobes, it suggested that the cuneus (the occipital visual cortex) was controlled by the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.",

Several studies have worked on the relation between individual difference in cognitive ability and the network organization of the brain [1,2]. However this relation is still poorly understood.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the relation between resting state functional connectivity and performance in a working memory task. Spontaneous EEG of 15 subjects were recorded  for 2 minutes with closed eyes using 32-channel system. Then participants performed a verbal n-back task. The correlation coefficient between channel pairs during the rest period was used as a measure of functional connectivity. Connectivity matrix was thresholded according the predefined connection density. Global efficiency, local efficiency and modularity were computed from the processed connectivity matrix, normalized and statistically analyzed.\n\nWe showed that there is a relation between functional integration and cognitive performance. Global efficiency is significantly correlated with performance especially in beta (r=0.52, p=0.045) and gamma (r=0.58, p=0.023) bands. Besides, there is also significant correlation between modularity and performance in beta band (r=0.55, p=0.33) . Our results  are mainly compatible with previously published studies where they reported that global efficiency and modularity are the predictors of cognitive performance regardless of the cognitive task domain [3-5]. However, there are conflicting results on the local efficiency depending on the cognitive task [2,5].",

        "text": "I. Purpose:\nFunctional brain imaging by MRI (fMRI) is non-invasive and allows for repetitive, non-invasive measurements of CNS functions. Recent developments allowed investigating brain structure specific function in transgenic animals. This allows detailed investigations of the impact genetic modifications on brain functions. Moreover various databases are established by 3D mapping of gen specific expressions. Here we establish a workflow to fuse all such datasets in a common reference (atlas) system supporting mutual data probing.\n\nII. Methods:\nThe major image analysis tool used in our working group, MagnAn, is based on IDL (® ExelisVIS), a high-level development environment for data analysis and visualization. MagnAn offers also routines for segmentation, file conversion and registration of fMRI-images. Registration with MagnAn is done by calling the appropriate Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs), which allows registering images at sub-voxel level. FMRI datasets consists of functional data as well as anatomical data at identical positions as the functional data.\nRegistration Workflow\nBecause the anatomical data have higher spatial resolution they provide more information content for establishing the registration process. Therefore, registration transformation was derived from anatomical data and in a second step applied to the functional data. First the MRI data were converted from lab own format to nifty format including setting the correct orientation matrix and Right-Superior-Anterior (RSA)-orientation. As a fixed image, the ABA mouse template with the voxel size of 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm is used.\n1)\tRegistration of anatomical fMRI mouse images\n\nAs a first step, the brain segmentation of anatomical fMRI mouse images with dimensions: 256x256x26 (high resolution RARE images) was performed within MagnAn.\nNext, a bias field correction is performed, as implemented in the ANTs N3 routine.\n\nFor registration of the anatomical images (as moving images) to the ABA mouse template (as a fixed image), the following steps are made:\n(1)\tCenter of mass alignment (which is an important step for optimizing the further steps);\n(2)\tGenerating a composite transform by calling “antsRegistration.exe”, which contains:\n-\ta derived initial moving translation (type = affine transform);\n-\ta rigid transform (type = Euler 3D transform);\n-\tan affine transform (type = affine transform);\n-\ta warping (type = displacement field transform).\nMultiple metrics were tested and the metric chosen for computing the transformations was “mutual information (- mi)”, because of the multimodal characteristic of the used data, as well as for speed considerations. The exact parameters established for the registration were found using an empirical process.\nThe obtained transformation matrices and the displacement vector field are stored in a dedicated folder “ANTS_matrix” for being accessible for further application for registration both of anatomical and of functional images.\n(3)\tApplication of the transformations (rigid, affine and warping) by calling the ANTs routine “antsApplyTransforms.exe”.\nThe obtained warped output images have the dimensions of the ABA mouse template [114x80x132] and are cback-onverted afterwards to our lab own format for further analysis with the MagnAn routines.\n\n2)\tRegistration of functional fMRI mouse images\n\nBy using the General Linear Model (GLM) approach offered by BrainVoyager, functional maps (z-score-images) are obtained, which have to be registered to the ABA mouse template for identifying activated brain regions. This serves as a first step of further data analysis for stimulus driven as well as resting-state data leading. Based on this brain structure identification further analyses like graph theoretical analysis are routinely performed.\nFirst, the functional images are converted to “.nifti”-format and then up scaled to the resolution of [256x256x26], to match the size of the anatomical images.\nNext the transformation matrices and the displacement vector field obtained in the first step of registration of the corresponding anatomical images to the ABA mouse template are used for application to the functional images (as moving images) by calling the appropriate ANTs routine.\nThe obtained warped output images have the dimensions of the ABA mouse template [114x80x132] and are back-converted afterwards from “.nifti”- to “.float”-array-format for further processing.\n\nIII. Results:\n\nWe obtained a powerful pipeline tool allowing to fuse datasets from non-invasive functional imaging methods (BOLD fMRI) resp. anatomical imaging methods (MRI) to 3D gen expression patterns (ABA) and high resolution connectivity data (ABA). The software tools are smoothly integrated in the normal fMRI analysis workflow. Establishing the registration transformations takes around 5 min per dataset on average desktop PC's; applying the transformations to the functional data only takes a few seconds.\n\nIV. Conclusion:\n\nThe presented tool allows for obtaining anatomical and functional MRI datasets registered to the ABA atlas. Because the ABA serves as the most detailed database for genetic as well as connectivity data, our methods allows for future detailed investigations of the relationships between structural and functional brain regions and there genetic expression pattern.",

To handle the rapidly growing amount of data, automatically segmenting single-neuron images from the raw data correctly and tracing them for 3D reconstruction becomes a key challenge in the connectomic era. Here we address this challenge with an automatic processing algorithm NeuroRetriever (NR), including two major components: fast automatically structural tracing (FAST) and arborization robustness index (ARI) scoring system for digitally reconstructing single neurons. First, use FAST to pre-trace the candidate set of voxels for the target neuron selected by the high-dynamic-range (HDR) thresholds strategy. Second, score the importance of each voxel in the candidate voxel set according to the pre-traced branch information for each intensity threshold and sum up the scores obtained from all thresholds to give the ARI for each voxel. Finally, mask the original image according to ARI of each voxels to obtain the single-neuron segmentation. With NR, a good accuracy single neuron image could be obtained automatically and easily. In summary, NeuroRetriever provide an efficient, automatic and unbiased framework for the neuroimage processing and will advance the contribution of fluorescence microscopy to connectomics.",

        "text": "Introduction\nIn recent years, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has attracted attention as a noninvasive functional neuroimaging technology. fNIRS visualizes brain activity by measuring the hemodynamic responses of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) associated with neural behavior. fNIRS allows us to identify a cortical activation or brain regions associated with a given stimulus by analyzing the time courses of oxy- and deoxy-Hb.\nHowever, since fNIRS signals often contain noises (e.g., motion-related artifacts and psychological noises including heartbeat), it is not easy to extract meaningful brain activation. Furthermore, comparison of the raw fNIRS data between subjects should not be done because fNIRS detects only the relative change in oxy- or deoxy-Hb. To perform a group analysis, baseline calibration is also needed. However, there is no established way for preprocessing of fNIRS signals.\nThe purpose of this study was to estimate the brain regions associated with a given task or stimulus by automatically extracting features of cortical activities from the fNIRS data. We proposed a novel feature extraction method for the fNIRS signals whose temporal and spatial characteristics were considered.\n\nMethod\nDeep learning methods have been mostly used for classification of multi-dimensional data, however, in this study, we focused on another aspect of the deep learning methodology regarding determination of region-of-interest (ROI) associated with a given task or stimuli.\nIn our proposed approach, a group classifier is constructed from all subject fNIRS data using supervised learning. The group classifier is constructed for all channels of a fNIRS measurement system, and a group label is supervised during each learning process. After the learning is completed, the classification accuracy using only a single channel is compared among all channels, and the channel whose classification accuracy has better performance is extracted as the critical ROI for group classification.\nMoreover, we proposed a new deep learning algorithm which is a fusion of two algorithms, convolutional neural network (CNN) [1] and long short-term memory (LSTM) [2]. Although both algorithms can automatically perform feature extraction, CNN preserves the spatial information on input data during learning, and LSTM stores the temporal information. Taking advantage of these two algorithms, our proposed algorithm basically consisted of five layers, input, convolution, LSTM, pooling, and output layer. We can identify the ROI because neuron units of the input layer are associated with the fNIRS probes placed on participants' head.\n\nExperiments\nTo examine the effectiveness of our approach, we tried to extract the ROIs related to working memory. Cerebral blood flow during N-back (N=2, 3) task, which was often used to assess the working memory, was measured using fNIRS. 30 healthy male subjects (average age: 23.3 ± 1.5 years, right-handed) and 5 healthy female subjects (average age: 21.7 ± 0.52 years, right-handed) participated in the experiment. The fNIRS probes were placed according to the International 10–20 system. Using the fNIRS data obtained, our classifier is trained to classify the input data as either “2-back” or “3-back.”\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe average percentage of correct answers in 2-back (low degree of difficulty) and 3-back (high degree of difficulty) tasks were 90.2 ± 8.98% and 84.3 ± 8.87%, respectively. It was shown to be significantly different by Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p <0.01).\nUsing this fNIRS data, our classifier achieved the classification accuracy of 91.4 ± 1.49%. Moreover, with a comparison of single-channel classification accuracy for all channels, we successfully extracted left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC) as task-related ROIs.\nDLPFC is activated in a number of working memory task and cognitive task, and is also known to play a key role in cognitive control and adaptation of a strategy to improve the task performance. In particular, the left DLPFC is said to be activated in verbal working memory task [3].\nAPFC is the area where highly abstract information is processed. It has also been reported that APFC and DLPFC had activated in a dual-task situation [4]. Furthermore, activation of DLPFC and APFC is associated with the difficulties of N-back problems [5][6]. These observations suggest that the ROIs estimated by the proposed method are reasonable. Consequently, our proposed method has been shown to be useful for a brain function analysis of fNIRS data.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nBrain atlases are widely used in brain imaging to associate a structural or functional label with a position in a coordinate system, often defined within a brain reference space such as the MNI 305. Atlases are typically composed of a series of images, or a single parcellated image of a typical or averaged brain. They utilise either hard labels (zero, one, or several labels for a given position), or probabilistic information indicating the likelihood of a label.  Atlases exist for both 3D and surface geometry and can represent various types of information (e.g. cytoarchitectonic or anatomical macroscopic sulco-gyral information, functional information, etc). While most researchers in neuroimaging will use one or several brain atlases in their analyses, the meta data and data format of these atlases vary. This implies that custom code will be written to extract the information and comparison of analyses will be harder to conduct. For example, the Harvard-Oxford (HO), Automatic Anatomical Labelling (AAL), Freesurfer labels, and JuBrain labels are amongst the most used atlases and do not represent their respective metadata or data in a consistent manner. There is also a growing number of functional parcellations and atlases of functional networks.\nWhile atlases are ubiquitous and growing in number, there is no standard way of describing the information they contain, even for very similar types of atlases such as the HO and AAL. This is inefficient for developers and error prone, making the combination of atlases difficult and preventing easy experimentation and comparison. More broadly, the absence of a clear description and format makes the concept of what is an atlas (versus a template or a coordinate system) unclear.\n\nMethods\n\nThe definition of a new standard raises both technical and sociological issues. We capitalised on the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility neuroimaging data sharing and atlasing programs, and gathered a group of researchers with competencies and experience in human brain atlases.\nTo constitute the working group, we reached out to the main neuroimaging software developers and to large projects such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Human Connectome Project, as well as to neuroanatomists to obtain a good representation of both the developers of tools and the neuroscience community. This multi-pronged approach seems to have worked extremely well by bringing together the producers and the distributors of atlases within the community.\nWe met in person at the MNI in Montreal to first establish the specifications and use cases of this new format, and later at  MIT with remote video connections to collaborators who were unable to attend personally. Over the course of those few days, we were able  to create a new atlas standard format and several use-case examples of atlases following this specification. We used  collaborative development tools such as Google documents and GitHub to further discuss and improve these specifications and to develop a first implementation of the format for five atlases : HO, AAL, an adult mouse and a mouse development atlas, and the neuromorphic atlas.\n\nResults\n\nOur first proposal is described with five JSON examples at https://github.com/INCF/HAWG-examples. To ease the adoption of the format, we separated the metadata level information (the description of structures, the labels, etc) from the low level information – the image format. In every case, our group opted for simplicity in implementation, both to ease adoption and to reduce confusion. We converged on using JSON to encode this high level information, which will contain the description of the image files (NIFTI or other). While we recommend using NIFTI because it is widely used, other formats could possibly be used but may not be easily read by all applications. We use labels and tags that provide a more general framework than hierarchical structures. We also chose not to impose specific ontologies at this stage, although a recommended set of terms / ontologies may be proposed in the future. Importantly, the atlas specification is not specific to human brains, and has been written generically to contain support for any species or organ. Already some validation tools are emerging for this format - https://github.com/stity/atlas-schema.\nOur next phase will be to reach out to the whole community for feedback and discussion before releasing the image format, and to propose reference implementations in current neuroimaging software (SPM, FSL,AFNI FreeSurfer, MINC, MRIcro, Allen Institute Brain tools, and others).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility supports the creation and funding of  working groups and helps organize these standardization projects. This was necessary to overcome the social and technical challenges that the specification of a new standard format faces. We hope – and believe – that this should foster a more efficient research in neuroimaging.",

        "text": "Introduction:\nMany recent studies suggest that generalized seizures arise from abnormality in whole brain networks (Richardson et al. 2012). Most evidence shows abnormalities in static networks (e.g. reduced default mode network connectivity). In this study, we are interested to investigate dynamic changes in the level of synchrony during generalized spike and wave discharge (GSW) period using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings.\nMethods:\nThree patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy underwent four resting state scans (each scan lasts ~10 minutes). Pre-processed fMRI data were band-pass filtered between 0.04-0.07 Hz (Glerean et al. 2011) and a Hilbert transform was applied. The AAL atlas was used to divide the brain into 90 cortical regions, with each region represented by the first principal component of the instantaneous phase of all voxels in the region. We estimated a binary synchronization matrix at each time-point with regions considered to be synchronized if the phase difference was less than π/6, giving 296 binary synchronization matrices for each subject (Ponce-Alvarez et al. 2014). Tensor decomposition technique was then used to extract sub-networks, resulting in 9 major components (90x90 matrices). GSW periods were marked by an experienced neurologist.\nResults:\nA total of 32 GSW occurrences were found in this study. Figure 1 shows an example of temporal evolution of nine subnetworks in patient-1. From visual inspection (see Figure 1B/1C), 20 out of 32 SWD occurrences (63%) were found during a minimum of network synchrony (or turning point, labelled as T in Fig 1B/C). One the other hand, 9 events (27%) were found while the net contribution from all subnetworks was in a maximum stable-and-synchronous state (or plateau state, labelled as P in Fig 1B/C). The remaining 3 GSW occurrences (10%) were unclassified.\n\nFigure 1: Subnetwork structure of spatiotemporal synchronization patterns in patient-1. A) The 9 detected subnetworks. B) Temporal activation strength of each subnetwork. C) Total activation strength of all nine subnetworks (which represents a level of total network synchrony). D) Temporal evolution of phase difference throughout the ~10 minute scan. E) Band-pass filtered fMRI raw signals in 25 brain regions. The red stripes indicate the period during GSW. Note that T = turning and P = Plateau.\n\nConclusion:\nUp to now, the mechanism underlying seizure generation is not yet clear. The results from this study may suggest two possible causes of SWD generations: (1) transition between two states, which may cause instability in the brain networks or (2) over synchronization of the brain networks. In the future, a larger study population is needed to address these two hypotheses.",

        "text": "SpiNNaker is a digital neuromorphic hardware designed to reduce simulation time and power consumption compared to traditional computing architectures. While it is able to simulate artificial neural networks with 1 ms resolution in real time, its performance for biologically realistic models necessitating shorter integration time steps and featuring a convergence of on the order of 10,000 synapses per neuron has not been fully tested. Furthermore, simulations on SpiNNaker have previously been downscaled compared to the biological numbers of neurons and synapses [1, 2].\n\nWe here describe the first full-scale simulations of a cortical microcircuit model [3] on SpiNNaker, comparing performance with that of NEST [4]. With approximately 80,000 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and 0.3 billion synapses, this model is the largest simulated on SpiNNaker to date. The scale-up is enabled by recent developments in the SpiNNaker software stack (https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester) that allow simulations to be spread across multiple boards. The implementation uses the simulator-independent description language PyNN [5].\n\nWe consider two types of NEST simulations: one with spikes constrained to a 0.1 ms grid, and one with spikes in continuous time. The comparison with the latter provides a sensitive test for the correctness of SpiNNaker after a major reorganization of its software stack. We describe deterministic comparisons of the single-neuron dynamics and statistical comparisons of the network dynamics, quantified in terms of firing-rate distributions, spiking irregularity, and correlations in the activity of different neurons. These comparisons reveal close correspondence of the NEST and SpiNNaker results, demonstrating the usability of SpiNNaker for large-scale networks with biological time scales.",

        "text": "As neuromorphic hardware platforms become more widely available it is important to assess and compare them in the context of the specific task they are required to address. This includes not only adeptness at the task, but also their speed, scalability, power use and ease of implementation.\"\"We report the practical implementation of a bio-inspired, spiking model for multivariate classification on three different platforms: the hybrid digital/analogue Spikey, the digital spike-based SpiNNaker, and GeNN, a meta-compiler for parallel GPU hardware. We assess performance using a benchmark digit classification task.\"\"We found that whilst a different implementation approach was required to create a functioning classifier for each platform, for all three a large fraction of the computing time ended up spent off-device, and on a host machine. Time was spent in combinations of model preparation, encoding suitable input spiking data, shifting data and decoding spike-encoded results. Total power consumed was correspondingly skewed toward the host machine. These observations imply that the efficiency advantage of specialised hardware is easily lost in excessive host-device communication, or non-neuronal parts of the computation. As a result, at smaller model scales, host-only serial implementations outperformed all three platforms. \"\"We conclude that the results emphasise the need to remain “on-device” to leverage the low power consumption and high parallelisation advantages of neuromorphic platforms. In response, we present early results of a revised model which shifts the pre-processing stage of the current model off the host. Instead of employing a host CPU-based algorithm such as neural gas or SOM, we introduce a neuromorphic-based first stage which applies association plasticity and lateral inhibition to self-organise the raw dataset. Classification results are comparable.",

And background levels are sharply imprecise, with approx. 40-50 percent of radiated phone energy absorbed into the brain. To assess the spontaneous locomotors activity (SLA) of the mice brain after the acute exposure of cellular telephone (GSM900MHz) is the major objective of our study.10 mice of the 30 days old (average weight 30gm) were grouped as control and EMR and they were habitualised for one week prior to start the experiment in well designed circular cell phone exposure (CCPE) cage. In the cage, cellular phone was placed in the center and mice were allowed to move around the device within 10 cm. radius. 3 hours/day exposure was applied to the mice of EMR group by the cellular phone in CCPE cage. The exposure to GSM900MHz EMR from CP in rats caused a decrease in total distance travelled (12%), moving time (23%), rearing (25%) and an increase in time resting (10%) as compared to rats in the control group. Simultaneous without GSM900MHz EMR from CP in rats increased the total distance travelled (9%), moving time (4%) and rearing (6%) and decreased the resting time (1%) as compared to rats exposed with GSM900MHz EMR. Although distance travelled, moving time and rearing decreased in the sham group compared with controls; these parameters remained decreased as compared to sham group. No significant changes on any of these parameters were observed in rats exposed to GSM900 EMR as compared to controls.",

        "text": "Introduction\n3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) is a unique technique to measure spatial orientation of nerve fibers at resolutions of a few microns [1, 2]. The orientations are derived from birefringence measurements of unstained histological brain sections that are interpreted by a voxel-based analysis, i.e. each tissue voxel is assigned a single 3D fiber orientation vector. The 3D reconstruction of images of serial brain section by means of image registration yields a virtual brain model reflecting local fiber orientations, which can be visualized as 3D vector field.\nTo compare such fiber models with existing parcellations schemes and atlases, the model has to be transferred into a common atlas space. The superimposition of such an atlas with fiber models enables an in-depth, voxel-based anatomical analysis of fiber orientations in 3D space.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThe fiber orientation model of the present study was derived from measurements of an entire Wistar rat brain. The brain was serially cut with a cryostat microtome into 446 sections with 60 μm thickness each. The sections were successively scanned with the in-house developed polarimetric setup (i.e., the large-area polarimeter) and subjected to a dedicated analysis workflow [1, 2]. After the 3D reconstruction of the sections by means of sequential application of affine and B-spline based image registration [3], the model was transferred into the common rodent reference space, the Waxholm Space atlas [4, 5] using 3D affine and elastic image registration methods [6]. The generated fiber orientation model of the rat consists of a 3D vector field with a size of 588 x 723 x 413 voxels and with a voxel size of 64 μm x 64 μm x 60 μm. The total size of the data set is 2.1 GB.\nIn order to visualize the fiber orientation model, the 3D orientation vector for each voxel was extracted and represented as a scalable glyph, i.e. as lines, cuboids or cylinders [7]. To improve the visual impression of the fiber orientations, the vectors were color-coded with RGB, HSV or a special HSV black color space. The parcellations of the Waxholm Space atlas were used as masks to visualize the fiber orientations in anatomical regions of interest (ROI). Furthermore, the brain hull, derived from the reconstructed brain model, was visualized together with the vector field to preserve the anatomical context for the observer.\n\nResults\nFigure 1 demonstrates the use of the atlas parcellations to show fiber orientations in anatomical ROI. Our graphical user interface enables the user to choose between 96 atlas structures (fig. 1, center). As examples, we have visualized the corpus callosum (fig. 1(a)), the hippocampal formation (fig. 1(b)), the striatum (fig. 1(c)), and the subiculum (fig. 1(d)). After selecting an anatomical ROI, the complex fiber architecture can be investigated under different viewpoints and magnifications by using tools for rotation, translation, and zooming as demonstrated for the corpus callosum (fig. 2). Figure 3 illustrates the fiber architecture of the corpus callosum in more detail. The displayed fiber orientations unveil the complex network of fibers and fiber bundles in the corpus callosum. The visualization tool shows that the orientation of fibers in the corpus callosum is not restricted to bundles running in parallel in the midline region, and then fanning out, but rather shows an architecture with partly abrupt changes in orientation (fig. 3, arrows) and fibers crossing the corpus callosum orthogonally, including regions close to the midline (fig. 3, circles).\nIn addition, the present method enabled overcoming the problem of visual clutter and tangle, which is a typical challenge for vector field visualization. By masking out the structures of interest, the amount of data to visualize has been reduced, thus allowing to study fiber orientations interactively.\n\nConclusion\nWe introduced a method to facilitate 3D studies of high-resolution fiber architecture, based on the fiber orientation models derived from 3D-PLI. The use of atlas-based parcellations turned represents a powerful approach to interpret the topography of fibers, but also to improve visualization in anatomical ROI. It enabled new insights into the complex fiber architecture of the rat brain, and unveiled the different orientations and interrelations of fibers and fiber bundles.\nPLI-based vector-type datasets are essential prerequisites for comprehensive fiber tractography at high spatial resolution, e.g. revealing the fanning out of fibers of the corpus callosum when moving from the midline to more sagittal sections. By means of our atlas-based visualization tool, fibers and fiber bundles have been detected, which were running in rostro-caudal direction, unexpectedly close to midsagital plane of the corpus callosum, which are dominated by fibers interconnecting the two hemispheres.\n\nFigure 1: The atlas based visualization enables anatomical studies of the fiber architecture of 96 structures (center), for instance, corpus callosum (a), the hippocampal formation (b), the striatum (c), and the subiculum (d). The colors (here in HSV color space) indicate the orientation of the fibers.\n\nFigure 2: A coronal view of the fiber architecture of the corpus callosum; lower left: coronal section of the Waxholm atlas (a). The orange arrows point to the corpus callosum in the 3D fiber orientation model (b). Interactions with the model facilitate visual analysis in diverse perspectives, for instance rotation to left (c) and right (d).\n\nFigure 3: Zooming into the fiber orientation model of the corpus callosum enables new insights in the fiber architecture. It unveils different orientations and interrelations, for instance fiber orientations from left to right (arrow 1), lower right to upper left (arrows 2 and 5 with different angles), lower left to upper right (arrows 3 and 4), and from bottom to top (arrow 6). The circles point to diverse sites, where fiber orientations are perpendicular to each other. This indicates regions with fibers running orthogonal to the image plane.",

        "text": "Brain-CODE is Ontario Brain Institute’s (OBI) extensible large-scale neuroinformatics platform that manages the acquisition, storage, sharing, and analytics of multi-dimensional data [1]. Brain-CODE is currently used as a central platform for collecting data from OBI’s Integrated Discovery Programs (IDPs) that spans 5 major brain disorders including neurodevelopmental disorders (POND), cerebral-palsy (CP-NET), epilepsy (EpLink), depression (CAN-BIND), and neurodegeneration (ONDRI) [2]. With over 400 researchers and research staff using the platform, Brain-CODE hosts a wide array of data spanning clinical research data, neuroimaging data, molecular data, as well as many other data modalities from over 5000 participants. Figure 1 illustrates OBI's integrated research approach.\n\nData Integration\n\nInsights from combined integrated data can potentially lead to unprecedented opportunities to uncover mechanisms of brain disorders.\n\nBrain-CODE adopts a multi-stage approach to achieve the integration of data and maximize its use across brain disorders. These stages are:\n1.\tModality-specific data capture software\n2.\tStandardized procedures and assessments: clinical common data elements, standardized imaging requirements, etc.\n3.\tBaseline quality assurance and quality control\n4.\tCombining multi-modal datatypes\n\nModality-specific data capture tools are the first stage of integration as they provide a common way to organize electronic study forms and projects across multiple sites. Overall, Brain-CODE adopts web-based applications to facilitate the centralization and accessibility of these tools. For clinical assessments and other form-based data, REDCap [4] and OpenClinica [5] have been adopted, XNAT [6] was adapted to a version called SPReD [7] for imaging, and LabKey [8] was adopted for molecular data collection.\n\nStandardization of variables and experimental processes is the next stage to achieve effective integration of research data. Based on existing standards, and working with the research community through a Delphi consensus process, OBI has established a core set of Common Data Elements (CDEs) to be used by all human studies [9]. More recently, OBI has also defined a base set of experimental parameters to be adopted across all EEG studies, sites, and brain disorders. Genomic standardization is the next phase where participation in international efforts such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) [11] will help identify standards for greater interoperability and analytic potential.\n\nBaseline quality assurances and quality controls validation techniques are essential for ensuring that data are collected with well calibrated instruments and verify that output files meet minimum standards such as: subject, variable, file, or project naming; acquisition sequence naming and protocols; output from quality control pipelines; clinical field score validation; case report form logic consistency; flagging outlier values and missing values; etc.\n\nThe final stage of data integration on Brain-CODE involves combining datasets from various modalities. Current transactional tools used for clinical data capture are usually based on relational databases, but also include data models represented as XML schemas and flat files. The integration and federation subsystem within the Brain-CODE platform combines datasets from various modalities to produce unified views and stage data for multi-variate analyses. The integration/federation pipeline starts by creating a transitional read-only data store from an enterprise-level data gathering process, followed by selective restructuring of some data components. The IBM InfoSphere Federation Server [12] was adopted to provide a thin, but crucial, virtual data definition layer that allows seamless communication with data sources irrespective of their vendor and format. An API based on backend technologies relies on this federation capability to provide subject-oriented, de-normalized mart-like data tables, within a DB2 database environment, thus laying the grounds for the various analytics and reporting tools. Figure 2 illustrates data integration on Brain-CODE.\n\nOverall, integration plays an essential role in maximizing the value of data, but such processes must also ensure that data can be easily accessed, probed and analysed. In the following we describe the value of adopting visualization tools for initiating the insight process from the integrated data.\n\nVisual Exploration\n\nOne of the major challenges for Brain-CODE researchers and research administrators is the monitoring of studies as research is distributed across a multitude of sites with independent schedules and priorities. To help facilitate this, OBI worked with researchers to developed visual data dashboards based on Spotfire by Tibco [13]. Spotfire provides an excellent solution to connect to the IBM InfoSphere Federation Server which retrieves the integrated query results from the federated databases on Brain-CODE. Furthermore, Spotfire enables the creation of a web-based visualization widget that dynamically loads data upon update and allows for user interactions for operations such as item selection, filtering, querying, etc.\n\nA general view dashboard capturing the overall data collection status of all OBI-funded programs was created to enable general tracking of study progress.  Valuable information signalling the progress of programs related to participant recruitment, challenges with study administration or data upload can be detected on a single view with key metrics. In addition, dashboards were created to support research administrators to review the overall progress of data collection for individual programs or studies. Typical measures are captured such as the number of participants recruited per research site, basic demographics, number of data records per modality, etc. These dashboards permit ongoing quality control and communication between sites and play an increasingly important part in the research process. Figure 3 illustrates an example visual dashboard for study data overview.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall the challenge of building a large-scale platform that collects a broad spectrum of data types from multiple domains or disorders requires a combination of robust operational management, effective data technologies, and researcher engagement. Already, OBI IDPs, such as the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network for Depression (CAN-BIND), are gaining value from the data integration and visualization available on Brain-CODE for early data monitoring and research planning [14]. Finally, by adopting international standards, Brain-CODE will participate in a rich ecosystem with other data partners for greater insights into brain and health.",

        "text": "Background: Working memory (WM) is a cognitive memory buffer and an imperative process for reasoning, comprehension, learning and memory updating and it is liable for the transitory holding and processing of new and previously stored information. The aim of this study is to visualize the functional connectivity between different electroencephalograph (EEG) electrode locations while performing working memory task. \"\"\"\"Methods: The working memory capacity of twenty random, healthy adult participants was evaluated with the help of Operation Span (OSPAN) task. The brain activity was measured using EEG and the variations in EEG frequency bands were evaluated for distinguishing an internally generated form of intended encoding depicted by alpha desynchronization and theta synchronization. The functional connectivity of different EEG frequency bands was visualized using the correlation matrix for two different conditions – task performance and rest. The highly correlated regions were also depicted visually by correlogram.\"\"\"\"Results: The functional connectivity of the alpha and theta bands during task performance show that pre-frontal (Fp1 and Fp2) and frontal (F3, F4, F7 and F8) electrode locations are strongly connected (r=0.9, p<0.001) indicating that these electrode locations are mainly involved in working memory. Also, on comparing the functional connectivity during the task performance with that of the rest period significant difference was noted in the visualization. Highly coherent pre-frontal and frontal electrode locations (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8) during task performance showed reduced coherence during the rest period indicating that those electrode locations were not actively involved in the rest condition. Moreover, significantly distinguished connectivities revealed different topographies in different frequency bands. \"\"\"\"Conclusion: Based on the results, the study concludes that the pre-frontal and frontal regions are mainly involved during the working memory task performance. Highly correlated functional connectivity was established at the beta band during task performance whereas highly correlated functional connectivity was established at the alpha and theta bands during the rest condition.",

        "text": "The human brain is an incredibly complex three dimensional object. Visualizing this object has become possible with the advent of neuro-imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI; 1). The images obtained with MRI are of crucial importance in clinical, educational, and research contexts. For example, in clinical contexts neurosurgeons may inspect MRI images to get an impression of the extent and character of brain abnormalities, and in educational contexts, students of the brain may use the images to learn about the basic anatomical facts of the brain. Finally, in research contexts, MRI images could be used to examine the spatio-temporal structure of functional activity in the whole-brain. Given the importance and widespread use of MRI images, good methods of visualization are required.\n\nCurrent techniques for visualizing MRI images rely on displaying 3D versions of the images on a 2D computer monitor (e.g., 2). This method of displaying 3D objects on a 2D medium has at least two major disadvantages. First, this method cannot reveal the accurate depth information of the 3D objects. Second, this method does not allow for an easy method of interacting with 3D objects. These disadvantages may hamper our current understanding of the 3D organization of brain abnormalities, anatomy, and functional activity.\n\nWe have attempted to solve some of these issues by using Virtual Reality (VR). Although techniques for VR have been around for years (3), recent technological advancements in small scale computing have made VR accessible to the masses. Specifically, modern mobile phones now posses sufficient computing power to render a fully interactive VR experience (4). Our particular VR set up relies on a low-cost solution: a standard Android phone (LG Nexus 5x) combined with a Google Cardboard headset. The rendering engine on the Android phone relies on the Unity3d platform (5).\n\nHere we present a prototype of our VR project to visualize MRI images. We will have three demos. First, we will show a fully rendered VR brain constructed from MRI images. Users can use the Google Cardboard button to 'cut' away parts of the brain to reveal the inside anatomy. Second, we will show a so-called 'surface' render of the brain that was obtained by analyzing MRI images with the software Freesurfer (6). Finally, we will show how the spatio-temporal structure of functional activity can be overlayed on existing VR renders of the brain. These three examples provide motivation for the use of VR in clinical, educational, and research contexts, and may provide further insight into the 3D organization of the brain.",

        "text": "Introduction\"\"Emotions are multifaceted circumstances of reaction that persuades our routine and varies among individuals. Human emotions can be generally discerned from the elicited electrophysiological effects. Assessing the complex nature of emotion creation has recently achieved spotlight status in the field of neurosciences. Analysis of parts of emotions such as subjective feelings, physiological responses and expressive behavior, pave way for better comprehension. The present study evaluated the effect of perceived and induced emotion emphasizing on the negative valence and high arousal emotion. Additionally the study also visualized the activation of different regions of brain and their connectivity when processing emotionally aroused pictures.\"\"Material and Methods\"\"Twenty healthy adult participants had no preceding information about the experiment were chosen for this study on their individual interest. The average age was 22 ± 0.85 and they were right handed in order to avoid the lobe lateralization. All volunteers read and signed an informed consent before participating. The normative visual emotional stimulus was selected from International Affective Picture System after obtaining appropriate consent from the IAPS database. Perceived emotion was quantified using the subjective ratings from the Self-Assessment Manikin Scale (SAM scale) and the brain activity was recorded using the EEG from every subject. The recorded EEG signals for different conditions were pre-processed using wavelet de-noising technique and offline analysis was performed using wavelet packet decomposition to extract the relative component energies of various EEG bands. Friedman test was performed to evaluate the overall significance among the measured parameters (relative alpha, beta, and theta component energies) as they were not normally distributed. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to measure the significant difference across the related groups and the significant value was set at p=0.05. Spearman rank-order correlation was carried out to understand the associations between the electrodes.\"\"Results and Discussion\"\"When the brain activation and functional connectivity representing the alpha EEG band was studied, the node strength at Fp1 was high for positive valence high arousal picture (Figure 1) when compared with negative valence high arousal pictures (Figure 2). The node strength at frontal electrode locations was same for both positive and negative valence pictures. The left frontal regions showed high functional connectivity with temporal and parietal lobe electrode locations, noted only for negative valence high arousal pictures. Apart from that a strong association was noted at occipital, parietal electrodes only while viewing negative valence high arousal pictures.\"\"In case of theta component energy, the node strength was high for right hemisphere electrode locations for negative valence high arousal pictures (Figure 3), this was not noted for positive valence (Figure 4). Strong functional connectivity and node strength were noted at temporal and parietal electrode locations for only negative valence high arousal pictures. The occipital lobe electrodes were equally engaged for both the valence categories. Due to the display of positive valence high arousal pictures, the left frontal electrode (f3) was engaged with temporal and parietal electrode locations. In theta band, the frontoplanar electrodes were not functionally related to negative valence whereas a strong inter-connectivity was established between them during positive valence high arousal pictures.\"\"The brain activation diagrams focusing on the Beta EEG band was scrutinized. During negative valence high arousal strong functional intra-connectivity was noted in beta component energy (Figure 5) at parietal, temporal and frontal lobe electrode locations. In the case of positive high arousal (Figure 6), the node strength at left frontal locations were high but they were not functionally connected, even though the node strength at the right frontal electrode location ( f4) was the lowest, it was observed to be highly associated with  temporal and parietal electrode locations. The occipital lobe electrodes were equally engaged for both the valences apart from that, the frontoplanar electrodes were not functionally related in support of beta component energy for both valences.\"\"Conclusion\"\"The present study concludes that the visualization of neuronal activity inclusive of intra and inter functional connectivity across various electrodes locations along with lobe lateralization provides better understanding of assorted emotional conditions. Based on the obtained results, a strong functional connectivity was noted at right frontal (F4)  with  temporal and parietal lobe electrode locations for alpha, beta and theta component energies while viewing negative valence high arousal pictures when compared to positive valence high arousal pictures. Similarly on observation, the occipital lobe electrodes (O1 and O2) were found to be equally engaged and highly correlated for both negative and positive valence categories. Particularly, when theta band was studied, there were considerable differences between the two valence categories, the frontoplanar electrodes (Fp1 and Fp2) were not functionally related in favor of negative valence whereas a strong inter-connectivity was seen to be established between them during positive valence high arousal pictures.",
