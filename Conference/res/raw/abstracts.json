        "text": "Chemical sensing is the oldest evolutionary adaptation and is used by almost all motile species from bacteria to mammals. Bacteria and other simple organisms use chemical gradients to move toward a desired area (chemotaxis). Larger animals such as fruitflies trying to find some nice rotting fruit or dogs tracking a scent trail use olfactory (and other cues like wind direction) to locate the desired source.  In this talk, I will present some recent work that we have been doing olfactory navigation, specifically, the problem of trail following and odor location.  I will start with a very simplistic model based on the assumption of a smooth gradient and show that even this problem leads to some very interesting mathematics. I then show some examples of the real world of odor distribution and why this is a really hard problem.  I will discuss several different approaches in this but the real work is just beginning.",

A training regimen whose benefits are so broad is rather unprecedented and provides a unique opportunity to identify factors that underlie generalization of learning and principles of brain plasticity. We propose that a common mechanism is at the source of this wide range of skill improvement. In particular, improvement in performance following action video game play results from greater learning to learn abilities. We will see that behavioral and neural markers of attentional control are enhanced in gamers, allowing them to better focus on the task at hand and ignore distractors or sources of noise. Such focus on task-relevant statistics appears to allow for not only more informed decision making but also faster learning and greater transfer. Practical applications from education to rehabilitation will be discussed.",

        "text": "The primate \"form\" processing pathway culminates in inferotemporal cortex, where objects are represented in a manner that allows their identity to be extracted invariant to details such as the particular position, size and background context with which they appear.  We have investigated the means by which these IT object-based representations intermingle with the more abstract rule-based representations required to solve two object-based tasks: finding a sought object and remembering whether an object has previously been encountered. Both tasks can be envisioned as a two-way classification of the task solution invariant to image and object identity (i.e., Is my target in view or not? Is the object in view novel or familiar?).  Within IT, we find that the identities of different objects are largely reflected as differences in the pattern of spikes across the population.  In contrast, rule-based representations are largely reflected in IT by changes in the overall numbers of spikes.  This type of configuration has the benefit of minimizing the interaction of IT object-based and rule-based representations.  However, this type of rule-based representation has the drawback that it can be easily confounded with changes in other parameters that impact the overall numbers of spikes across the IT population, such as image contrast, under the assumption of a simple, linear read-out.  In experiments designed to assess whether potential neural confusions between task rule and image contrast lead to behavioral confusions, we find that they do not, thus suggesting that rule-based information is read-out of IT using a read-out that is more sophisticated than a simple linear classifier.",

        "text": "A legacy of neuropsychology research is the tendency to associate a psychological process with a small number of brain areas necessary and sufficient for that process. However, most human psychological processes‚Äîeven those as basic and evolutionarily conserved as the experience of physical pain‚Äîare more likely to emerge from complex network dynamics that span multiple large-scale brain systems. When this is the case, predictive models of processes and behaviors that span multiple systems will outperform single-region based models, both in terms of predicting future behavior and understanding the underlying representations. In this talk, I show that this is the case for basic affective processes, including pain, negative emotion, and the vicarious ‚Äòpain‚Äô of observing others‚Äô suffering. Distributed predictive models dramatically outperform single region-models, and characterizing interactions across multiple systems is both necessary and sufficient to capture these forms of affective experience. In addition, such models are ‚Äòresearch products‚Äô that can be used, shared, and tested across laboratories. Doing so will accelerate the development of a cumulative neuroscience of human experience and behavior. In addition, testing brain models across many cognitive and affective conditions provides a way to validate psychological constructs in terms of their underlying neurophysiology.",

I will start by discussing the mechanisms of synaptic scaling, a form of cell-autonomous homeostatic plasticity, and the role of this plasticity in generating firing rate set-points in vivo. I will then discuss new work in which we follow the process of FR homeostasis in individual visual cortical neurons in freely behaving rodents as they cycled between sleep and wake states. When FRs are perturbed by visual deprivation, over time they returned precisely to a cell-autonomous set-point, and this restoration of firing occurred selectively during periods of active waking and was suppressed by sleep.  Longer natural waking periods result in more FR homeostasis, as does artificially extending the length of waking. This exclusion of FR homeostasis from sleep raises the possibility that memory consolidation or some other sleep-dependent process is vulnerable to interference from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms.",

In this talk I will show that the same principles can also be used to derive several properties of neural circuits, from the sub-cellular (synaptic and dendritic nonlinearities), through the cellular (spike timing responses), to the network level (population variability and dynamics). This is because the requirement to efficiently integrate information from several sources that are each unreliable to varying degrees is relevant at the biophysical as much as at the behavioural level.",

From these objective functions we derive online distributed algorithms that can be implemented by biological neural networks resembling cortical circuits. Our networks can adapt to changes in the number of latent dimensions or the number of clusters in the input dataset. Furthermore, we formulate minimax optimization problems from which we derive online algorithms with two classes of neurons identified with principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits.",

In this talk, I will discuss recent work using new network-analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of large-scale functional neural circuitry during human skill learning.  Our results show that learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and that the release of cognitive control hubs in frontal and cingulate cortices predicts individual differences in the rate of learning on other days of practice.  These data motivate a discussion of the fact that fundamental principles constraining the control of these dynamic network processes have remained elusive. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss recent work based on diffusion spectrum imaging data to estimate hard-wired pathways connecting different areas of the human brain. Using the mathematical foundation of network control theory, we show that structural network differences between subgraphs in the brain dictate their distinct roles in controlling brain function. More generally, our results support the view that macroscale structural design underlies basic cognitive control processes via the fundamental mechanism of network controllability.",

The catalog of types remains incomplete despite a century of research. We undertook a comprehensive classification based on reconstructions of all ganglion cells in electron microscopic images of a small patch of mouse retina. The unbiased sample of almost 400 neurons was classified into cell types, based chiefly on depth of dendritic stratification. We clustered the cells into more than 40 distinct types, almost all of which ‚Äútile‚Äù the retinal patch with little overlap between dendritic arbors. Our anatomical catalog suggests that the parallel effort to genetically define types is less than half done.

People are excited and worried about the use of prescription medication by healthy persons for the purpose of augmenting ‚Äúnormal‚Äú cognitive or affective function, i.e. aiming to influence brain function in individuals without recognized dysfunction. However, boundaries between therapy in sickness and enhancement in wellness are often imprecise in practice. Perspectives about disease and health evolve along a continuum of historical, cultural, and economic contexts. In this talk, I will sketch current possibilities to enhance brain function. I will then focus on the ethical and social questions on the practices, the motivations, and goals to enhance throughout life, from childhood to high age: Why do people even strive for neuro-enhancement? What are the chances and risks, individually and socially? The old question ‚Äúshould we do what we can do?‚Äú needs to be asked again by discussing which values we want to pursue in the context of further developments towards self-optimisation.",

        "text": "The classical view of the retina is that each subtype of ganglion cell extracts one feature from the visual scene, and that the population constituting a subtype provides a feature map to the brain. \nTo test this idea, we recorded a large population of ganglion cells from a single cell type (fast OFF) using large multi-electrode arrays in the rat retina responding to randomly moving bars. \nWhen only one bar was displayed, even cells whose receptive field was far from the bar responded reliably to motion. While the cells whose receptive field was in overlap with the bar could be well predicted by a linear (LNP) model, these distant cells responded in a non-linear manner. We found that a cascade model composed of two stages of linear-non-linear processing (LNLN) could predict the responses of these cells. Using this model, we demonstrate that, while the cells close to the stimulus were highly sensitive to the position of the stimulus, distant cells were largely invariant to this position and mostly coded for change in the speed of the bar. Therefore, within a homogeneous population of ganglion cells of the same subtype, two radically different computations were performed on the stimulus. \nFurthermore, the response of distant cells to motion outside the receptive field was strongly suppressed as soon as another bar was displayed inside their receptive field. When the second bar was added, most of these distant cells actively suppressed their response to the first bar, and coded the position of the second bar instead.\nWe found that combining our previous cascade model with a global gain control could account for the linear central response, the non-linear distant response and its suppression. Our results suggest that the retina is able to reallocate its neuronal resources in different regimes: the ganglion cells can actively respond to distant stimuli when their receptive field is not stimulated, but switch to a linear, position sensitive computation when their receptive field is stimulated. \nThese two computations might be useful to extract different features of the visual scene during saccadic vs fixational eye movements.",

        "text": "In visual cortex, local networks of co-tuned neurons manifest in a columnar\norganization, but also form distributed circuits with distant, but similarly co-tuned\nneurons several millimeters away. It has been hypothesized that co-tuning\nbetween neurons  might be dynamically established using patterns\nof spontaneous activity, however, experimental evidence supporting this scenario\nis scarce. Here we combined chronic epifluorescence and 2-photon imaging with\nquantitative analysis and modeling to dissect the organization of spontaneous\nactivity in the early ferret visual cortex in relation to the developing networks of\norientation selective domains which become apparent upon eye opening.\nWe find that by ten days prior to eye opening, cortical activity is already spatially\ncoherent on a columnar scale. The local activity correlation structure resembles a\nMexican-hat profile, an organization consistent with models for the activity\ndependent development of orientation domains. Remarkably, strong correlations\nwere present between cortical domains several millimeters apart, even at a\nstage in development when horizontal connections of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells\nremain primarily local. To understand how long-range correlations could arise\nfrom purely local connectivity, we generated a circuit model of rate units receiving weakly modulated random input drive with connectivity reflecting the experimentally observed Mexican-hat structure. This model produced modular activity patterns with long-range spatial correlations, arising through multi-synaptic heterogeneous recurrent feedback loops.\nAlthough activity correlations in the model vary smoothly across the\ncortex, they are systematically punctuated by abrupt discontinuities.\nNotably, we also observed such ‚Äòcorrelation fractures‚Äô in the structure of\nspontaneous activity in vivo, where they tend to co-align with pinwheel locations\nin the orientation preference map after eye-opening. Further, we find that several\ndays prior to eye opening, long-range correlations in spontaneous activity were\npredictive of future tuning similarity in the mature orientation map, providing\nadditional evidence for a developmental relationship between spontaneous\nactivity and co-tuned networks. We conclude that primitive circuits of the early\ncortex robustly generate both local and long-ranging structured correlations in\nspontaneous activity, which might form the basis for the development of co-tuned\nspatially distributed cortical networks.",

        "text": "The primary visual cortex contains a detailed map of the visual scene, which is represented according to multiple stimulus dimensions including spatial location, ocular dominance and stimulus orientation. While it is known that the maps for spatial location and ocular dominance arise from the spatial arrangement of thalamic afferent axons in the cortex, the origin of the orientation map remain unclear. A possible anatomical substrate for orientation maps could be the axonal arrangement of ON and OFF thalamic afferents in the cortex just as the substrate for ocular dominance maps is the arrangement of thalamic afferents from the contralateral and ipsilateral eyes. To test this hypothesis we introduced 32-channel multielectrode arrays (Neuronexus) horizontally into the cat primary visual cortex (V1). We measured ON and OFF retinotopy with light and dark stimuli and orientation tuning with moving bars. \n\nOur results [1] show that the cortical maps for orientation, direction and retinal disparity in the cat are all strongly related to the organization of the map for spatial location of light (ON) and dark (OFF) stimuli (Fig. 1a). We show that this organization is OFF-dominated and OFF-centric, i.e. OFF retinotopy is more precise than ON retinotopy and OFF acts as the anchor of the cortical retinotopic map [1, 2] (Fig. 1b). These unexpected results have now also been shown in tree shrew visual cortex [3], seem to be present in primate [1] and therefore are likely a common design principle in species with orientation maps. In this OFF-dominated and OFF-centric topography, changes in orientation and direction preference are determined by changes in ON/OFF retinotopy (Fig. 1c). Further, the cortical organization for ON/OFF runs orthogonal to the ocular dominance columns (Fig. 1d) and ON/OFF retinotopy is well matched at the ocular dominance border. This binocular match of ON/OFF retinotopy can explain why orientation preference shows a tendency to remain constant across the border of ocular dominance columns. Because the ON/OFF organization originates from clustering of ON and OFF thalamic afferents in the cat visual cortex [4] (Fig. 1e), we conclude that all main features of visual cortical topography, including orientation, direction and retinal disparity, follow a common organizing principle that arranges thalamic axons with similar retinotopy and ON‚ÄìOFF polarity in neighboring cortical regions.\n",

        "text": "Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic substrate of excitatory synapses in the adult neocortex. Typically neurons form synaptic connections through multiple synaptic contacts [1, 2] (dendritic spines) each of which is prone to stochastic transmission failures [3]. The size of individual spines changes on time-scales ranging from seconds to weeks, and is strongly correlated to the synaptic efficacy [4]. Through a process called synaptic turnover, small spines can be removed and new ones may form [4]. Importantly, despite continuous turnover, the density of spines in the tissue is preserved over time [4] and, while some transient spines disappear within a few days after formation, others are observed to persist for weeks or even months [4]. It is thus an important question how stable synaptic connections can be formed despite continuous dendritic spine plasticity and turnover.\n\nHere we present a model of the joint plasticity of multi-contact synaptic connections (Fig. 1). We propose a local spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule that describes the dynamics of individual synaptic contacts (dendritic spines). The dependence on spike timing makes our model sensitive to correlations of neuronal activity, leading to cooperation of synaptic contacts within a synaptic connection, and competition across synaptic connections.\n\nIn network simulations we show that our model reproduces the experimentally observed distributions of synaptic contact numbers [1], dendritic spine turnover ratio [4] and the emergence of long-term stable contacts [4]. Thereby, multiple contacts are crucial for long-term stability of synaptic connections, because (a) the contacts cooperate by increasing pre-post correlations [5] and (b) they increase the signal to noise ratio of synaptic transmission by averaging out stochastic transmission failures. In simulated input deprivation experiments we confirm that in the weeks following deprivation, the fraction of newly formed persistent contacts is elevated relative to the control condition [4], as the network rewires to compensate for the change of input.",

        "text": "Recording and modeling the coordinated activity of cellular events through volumes of intact mammalian tissue is a major challenge in biology that has inspired significant technological innovation. Despite this, scanless measurement of the high-speed activity of individual neurons across three dimensions in scattering tissue remains an open problem. Here we develop and validate a computational imaging approach (SWIFT) that integrates high-dimensional, structured statistics with light field microscopy [1] to allow the synchronous acquisition of single-neuron resolution activity throughout intact tissue volumes as fast as a camera can capture images (currently up to 100 Hz at full camera resolution). We demonstrate that this large field-of-view, single-snapshot volume acquisition method---which requires only a simple and inexpensive modification to a standard fluorescence microscope---enables scanless capture of sparse but coordinated activity patterns throughout mammalian cortical volumes both in vitro and in vivo. Further, the volumetric nature of SWIFT also allows fast in vivo imaging, motion correction, and cell identification throughout curved subcortical structures like the dorsal hippocampus, where cellular-resolution dynamics spanning hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, and CA3 can be simultaneously observed during a virtual context learning task in a behaving animal. In addition, because SWIFT is minimally damaging and effective in scattering tissue, it can be safely applied to the rapid cellular-resolution functional imaging and modeling of neural population dynamics in human cortical tissue. SWIFT‚Äôs ability to rapidly and easily record from volumes of many cells cortically and subcortically opens the door to widespread identification of dynamical motifs and timing dependencies among coordinated cell assemblies during adaptive, modulated, or maladaptive physiological processes in rodent and human neural systems. \n",

        "text": "In the neocortex, the trial-to-trial variability of the single neuron spike count is considerably high under spontaneous conditions. This can be strongly reduced by stimulus presentation or during movement execution  [1,2]. In single unit recordings from Macaque motor cortex during a delayed reaching task [2,3] we analyse the time resolved spike count and inter-spike-interval statistics. While across-trial variability measured by the Fano factor (FF) is clearly temporally modulated, interval variability quantified by different measures (squared coefficient of variation CV$^2$, local CV2 and local variation LV) shows only weak modulations (Fig. 1, upper panel).\n\nRecently, a series of studies have shown that the stimulus induced reduction in FF can be captured by balanced network models of integrate and fire neurons with clusters of stronger connectivity in the excitatory population [4,5,6]. In these networks, individual clusters cycle between states of high and low activity. This introduces firing rate variations, which increase the FF to values above unity. When a constant current stimulus is applied to one or several of the clusters, these clusters are clamped to the high activity state and others are suppressed through lateral inhibition. This mechanism quenches the rate variations and the FF is reduced. In these clustered networks, neurons in the active clusters fire at very high rates and may produce highly regular spike trains. Such high rate, regular spiking, is however inconsistent with findings in physiological recordings from the neocortex. \n\nUsing a mean field description of networks of binary neurons [7], we analyse the stable rate configurations of networks with clustered connectivity and show that the firing rates in the active states can be reduced by the additional introduction of inhibitory clusters. We then show that this result can be transferred to networks of spiking leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons where the inhibitory clusters preserve the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input currents in the high activity states. This leads to spike trains of constant irregularity at moderate firing rates also during the stimulation induced reduction of the FF (Fig. 1, lower panel) in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with our findings in the motor-cortical data set. The range of parameters over which cycling between clusters is achieved is thereby greatly increased, reducing the need for fine tuning of network parameters.",

        "text": "Adaptation is ubiquitous in sensory neurons and improves stimulus representations. Adaptation to various properties of the stimulus distribution, e.g. its mean or variance, coexist within the same sensory pathway, yet the interaction between different types of adaptation is rarely examined.\nWe address this issue in the context of courtship song recognition in the fruit fly. During courtship, the male produces a song, the features of which inform the female‚Äôs mating decision. Song is perceived using the arista, a feathery extension on the antenna and properties of this sound receiver pose challenges for encoding the song pattern: 1) Due to the high directionality of the sound receiver, changes in distance and angle between male and female induce strong fluctuations in sound intensity. 2) Gravity or wind also move the receiver and add a slowly varying offset to the antennal position.\nSound intensity and the antennal offset interfere with an efficient representation of song and the auditory system should hence correct for them through adaptation. Sound intensity and offset correspond to the variance and the mean of the antennal position; the auditory system should thus perform mean and variance adaptation.\nUsing electrophysiology and modeling, we examine adaptation in the fly‚Äôs auditory receptors ‚Äì Johnston‚Äôs organ neurons (JON). Previous studies have demonstrated mean adaptation in JON [1][2], which is subtractive and arises in the subthreshold currents. We here show that JON also adapt to sound intensity. Intensity adaptation is divisive and produces near intensity-invariant sound responses. It arises in the subthreshold responses of JON just like the mean adaptation. That two distinct forms of adaptation are implemented in the same cellular compartment raises the issue of how they interact: Antennal offset‚Äì and hence mean adaptation ‚Äì should not affect sound sensitivity. By independently controlling the mean and variance of antennal position during JON recordings, we find a unidirectional interaction: mean adaptation does not affect sound sensitivity (as desired) but intensity adaptation reduces responses to antennal offset.\nUsing modeling we examine the implementation of adaptation in JON. Only a serial arrangement in which mean adaptation precedes variance adaptation reproduces our data. In addition, rectification is essential for variance adaptation. This parallels findings in the retina, where variance adaptation also requires rectification [3].",

        "text": "Determination of the direction of an acoustic source, or sound localization, is a fundamental function of the auditory system. Interaural time and level differences (ITD/ILD) are major cues for binaural sound localization. Neurons in the lateral superior olive (LSO) located at the mammalian auditory brainstem receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that are driven by ipsi- and contralateral sound stimuli, respectively. In order to encode ILDs and envelope ITDs, LSO neurons act as anti-coincidence detectors of these inputs [1]. Previous anatomical studies found age-dependent loss of inhibitory inputs along the auditory system, whereas electrophysiological recordings reported relatively minor functional changes in aged LSO. In this study, we used a biologically plausible model of LSO and examined how inhibition loss may affect ITD and ILD coding. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the LSO were modeled as Poisson processes, whose intensity function was either temporally uniform (for ILD) or periodic (for ITD). Membrane and synaptic parameters were tuned to reproduce known LSO responses measured in vivo and in vitro. Simulated output spike rates of the model smoothly decreased with increasing contralateral sound intensity, resembling empirical ILD tuning. For low frequency envelopes, simulated spike rates periodically changed with the phase difference of binaural inputs, similar to ITD coding in the LSO. Reduction of the number of inhibitory inputs, which mimicked age-related inhibition loss, resulted in increased overall spike rates and decreased modulation depths (defined as the difference between maximum and minimum spike rates). These effects were considerably weakened when the reduced number of inhibitory inputs was compensated by an increased strength of each inhibitory input. These results suggest that age-related loss of inhibition could potentially be counteracted by activity-dependent plasticity, and may explain the discrepancy between previous anatomical and physiological findings in the aged LSO.

        "text": "Perception can be viewed as a combination of two information streams, one responsible to predict the sensory consequences of actions, and a second providing actual sensory observations. In order to compensate for the noise and uncertainty inherent in sensory information, the two streams are integrated to extract an internal model that predicts the sensory consequences of motor actions [1]. In both biological and technical systems such a model provides a belief of their state and is adjusted proportional to the uncertainty in the predictions [2].\nInspired by developmental processes known to occur in cortex, we propose a learning mechanism capable of representing such an internal model of sensorimotor space and the cross-sensory relations, by exploiting regularities in the sensorimotor streams [3]. As sensory and motor streams are not linked via some static mapping, such internal model predictions are biased affecting generalization to new tasks.\nBy exploiting regularities in sensorimotor mappings, structural learning is able to extract invariants between such mappings by learning the general rules that govern a set of tasks, enhancing adaptation and learning [4]. In this work we propose combining distributed representations, learning mechanisms, and structural learning in a generic computational framework targeting neuro-robotic systems. We believe that such a framework has potential to enhance the capabilities of today's robotic systems in handling complex dynamical operation scenarios.",

        "text": "One approach to model human strategies of obtaining reliable decisions under uncertainty considers the brain to act as a Bayesian Observer, integrating information from different modalities and previous knowledge. Responses are determined from a posterior distribution after fusion of noisy measurements with an internal prior distribution. The challenge for the creation of new models relates to both specifying the characteristics of independent measurements and priors involved (e.g. their modality specificity and learning ability), as well as to details of the integration process. It has been shown that Maximum Likelihood Estimation is well suited to describe multimodal integration of haptic and visual sensory input given different levels of background noise [1]. Recently, our group [2] compared a model fusing the measurement of a linear and angular displacement with a fixed prior to one in which the prior distribution is updated dynamically by a discrete Kalman filtering process after each trial. Both fusion and updating fully rely on the amount of measurement noise in the system. Our results showed that the dynamic model was able to predict regression to the mean, range effects and scalar variability. \nIn the present study, we aimed to extend the previous model to multimodal conditions. To this end, we compared the reproduction of perceived angular displacement under visual-only (optokinetic drum), vestibular-only (rotating chair) and bimodal conditions. Since according to our model regression to the mean is closely linked to the amount of measurement noise, we assumed that regression effects should be reduced in the bimodal as compared to the unimodal condition. Indeed, on average the slopes of reproduced vs. perceived displacement were significantly larger for the bimodal condition, corresponding to a decreased weight of the prior. We further investigated, whether bimodal responses can be predicted from weight estimates calculated from the unimodal conditions and tested this using models with amodal or modality specific priors and different varieties of fusion. In several subjects, assuming modality-specific priors yielded better model fits, suggesting that displacement of the environment is treated differently than self-displacement. While these preliminary results suggest that the visual-vestibular fusion process is suboptimal on average, one explanation for this finding are the observed between-subject differences in fusion strategies.

        "text": "Visual processing already begins at the first synapse of the visual system. In the mouse retina, three different types of photoreceptors (M-cones, S-cones and rods) provide input to 14 bipolar cell types (reviewed by Euler et al., 2014). The precise pattern of connectivity between them determines which signals are available to downstream circuits and therefore the entire visual system. While it has been shown that cone bipolar cell type 1 contacts M-cones and type 9 contacts S-cones selectively, most bipolar cell types are thought to contact all cones within their dendritic field (Haverkamp et al., 2005; Breuninger et al., 2011). ON bipolar cells would contact cones exclusively via so-called invaginating synapses, while OFF bipolar cells would form basal synapses.\nBy mining publically available electron microscopy data published by Helmstaedter et al. (2013), we confirm that there are no additional M- or S-cone selective bipolar cell types in the mouse retina; however, we found interesting violations of the established rules of outer retinal connectivity: Cone bipolar cell type X contacted only ~20% of the cones in its dendritic field and made mostly atypical non-invaginating contacts with cones. Types 5T, 5O and 8 also contacted fewer cones than expected from the extent of their dendritic field. In addition, we provide anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are interconnected in both directions: Not only OFF-types 3A, 3B and 4 get direct input from rods but also rod bipolar cells from cones. Together, this suggests that the organization of the outer plexiform layer is less straightforward than classically thought.\n",

        "text": "In their natural environment, animals sense and evaluate olfactory cues of time¬≠-varying composition and concentration. Their olfactory pathways are adapted to the natural stimulus  statistics, thus it is not surprising that odor processing is fast. Honey bees, for example, learn to discriminate odors presented for as short as 200 ms [5]. How is the insect olfactory system optimized to reliably estimate spatial and temporal aspects of the olfactory environment and what are the mechanisms behind rapid odor processing?\n\nTo understand the underlying mechanisms behind sensory processing we investigate odor  representations in two principal stages of the insect olfactory system. In the antennal lobe (AL) odor representations are dense and dynamic. In the Mushroom Body (MB) representations are sparse. Odor representations emerge within 50ms after stimulus onset and changes dynamically during and after stimulation[1,2]. We present a comprehensive spiking neural network model of the insect olfactory pathway that reproduces experimentally observed spatial and temporal patterns of the odor code in the AL and the MB [1, 3].\n\nWe investigate how odor responses at the AL and the MB are shaped by two mechanisms: (1) uniform lateral inhibition within the AL, and (2) cell intrinsic spike-¬≠frequency adaptation. Together, both mechanisms underly dynamic odor representation in the AL and account for spatial and temporal sparseness in the KC population. We show that odor correlations are retained in the AL and reduced in the MB.\n\nIn addition, decoding classification of temporal odor representations reveals optimal decoding performance during stimulus on¬≠ and offset. Interestingly, at the AL level odor identity can also be decoded during and well beyond stimulation. In contrast, at the MB level KC spikes establish a rapid but transient odor code, whereas a prolonged stimulus trace is found in intrinsic adaptation currents. Our approach allows us to investigate dynamical changes in odor representations and predicts odor after images.",

        "text": "In the primate brain, area MT is largely responsible for the processing and perception of motion in\nvisual scenes. MT neurons are tuned for the direction and the speed of moving stimuli and they\nrespond with pronounced firing rate transients upon a change in visual stimulation. These transients\nincrease the neurons' sensitivity and they are directly related to behavioural performances.\nTherefore, to gain a better understanding of the processing of dynamic visual scenes it is important\nto understand the neural processes that shape the transients in MT responses. We present a\ndynamical model of MT cells that takes the cells‚Äô speed and direction tuning into account and that is\nable to reproduce their experimentally observed transients. In its simplest version, the model\nconsists of only two coupled differential equations, representing an excitatory and an inhibitory\npopulation that make up a single direction column. Both populations receive the same external input\nand additionally the inhibitory population provides divisive inhibition to the excitatory one. Using a\nsimple optimization procedure, we fit the model to find close to perfect fits for the sustained and\ntransient phases in MT single cell responses. Based on the fit for each cell, the model reproduces\nand predicts neuronal responses to arbitrary accelerations and decelerations of a moving stimulus\nstarting from both low and high base speeds, including experimentally observed deviations of the\nactual transient as compared to the expected firing rate change as deduced solely from a neuron's\nspeed tuning profile. We also investigated the possible effects of spatial and feature-directed\nattention in our model and reproduced psychophysical reaction time distributions under different\nattentional conditions. In particular, we found increasing relative firing rate differences during the\ntransients the stronger the attentional modulation was prior to a stimulus change. This effect\nreversed in the sustained phase of the neurons' response, where relative activation decreased with\nincreasing attentional modulation. Our finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the shaping\nand attentional modulation of neuronal response transients, and underlines the importance of this\ndynamical mechanism for change detection.",

        "text": "When interacting with natural environments, we continuously face multiple opportunities for detecting/discriminating distinct sensory objects.  Presumably, actual perceptions reflect a continuous evaluation of alternatives, as they become available, and a constant rebalancing of persisting in a current perception, or switching to a different one [1]. Here we show that detailed measurements of binocular rivalry - a well-studied instance of perceptual bistability - reveal a hierarchical organization of the underlying neuronal substrate that seems ideally suited for balancing ‚Äòexploitation' and ‚Äòexploration' [2] in ecological sensory situations.  Specifically, we show that the $\\mathit{stationary}$ statistics of rivalry reversals (Gamma-shaped densities), as a function of two input contrasts ('Levelt's propositions', and 'scaling property' [3]), uniquely constrains the strengths of excitatory and inhibitory interactions between 'integration pools' and 'decision pools'.  Following [3], we model all pools as a finite number of discrete units, each expressing the spontaneous bistable dynamics of an attractor assembly (e.g., a cortical column or cluster of columns).  The mechanism exhibits unexpected $\\mathit{non-stationary}$ behaviours, which are corroborated by additional observations. Functionally, it continuously accumulates and discards sensory information.  Specifically, it comprehensively and losslessly accumulates evidence for alternative perceptions, until one exceeds a differential threshold.  Subsequently, it reverses evidence accumulation selectively for the winning percept, shifting the balance more and more in favour of alternative percepts.  The perceptual threshold changes inversely with evidence flux.  When compared to optimal statistical inference, the performance of this observation-derived dynamical mechanism balances 'excitation' and 'exploitation' nearly optimally for ecological object frequencies.  In addition to providing a simple and generic solution for inference during continuous detection/discrimination, the same mechanism also reproduces puzzling neural correlates of episodic choice discrimination [4].",

        "text": "Understanding sensory processing in the visual system results from accurate predictions of its neural responses to any kind of stimulus. Although great effort has been devoted to the task, we still lack a full characterization of primary visual cortex (V$1$) computations and their role in higher cognitive functional tasks (e.g. object recognition) in response to naturalistic stimuli. While previous goal-driven deep learning models have provided unprecedented performance on visual ventral stream predictions and revealed hierarchical correspondence, no study has used the representations learned by those models to predict single cell spike counts in V$1$. We introduce a novel model (Fig. $1$A) that leverages these learned representations to build a linearized model with Poisson noise. We separately use the representations of each convolutional layer of a near-state of the art convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on object recognition to fit a model that predicts V$1$ responses to naturalistic stimuli. When fitted to data collected from neurons across cortical layers in V$1$ from an awake, fixating monkey, we found that, as we expected, intermediate early layers in the CNN provided better performance on held out data (Fig. $1$B). Additionally we show that, using the best predictive layers, our model significantly outperforms classical and current state-of-the-art methods on V$1$ identification (Fig. $1$C). When exploring the properties of the best predictive layers in the CNN, we found striking similarities with known V$1$ computation. Our model is not only interpretable, but also interpolates between recent subunit-based hierarchical models and goal-driven deep learning models leading to results that argue in favor of shared representations in the brain.",

        "text": "Signals recorded from the primate brain, either using macro-electrodes placed on the scalp or micro-electrodes inserted in the cortex often show oscillations at different frequencies. One such oscillation is the Gamma rhythm, which has a center frequency that lies between 30Hz and 80 Hz, and is induced in the primary visual cortex by visual stimulation. Fries et al. (2007) suggested that Gamma rhythm supplies a temporal reference frame to the spiking activity, for which it should have a stable frequency and consistent phase across time. However, Xing et al., (2012) showed that the Gamma rhythm occurs in short bursts and is too noisy to act as a stable reference frame. They used continuous Gabor transform (short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window) to estimate the time-support of the Gamma rhythm. However, the time-frequency spectral estimate obtained using the spectrogram is noisy and has high variability (it follows an exponential distribution; (Brillinger, 1972)), which masks out the variability in the biological signal. In particular, because the power at any frequency follows an exponential distribution, it always appears bursty (few large values interspersed between many small values). Consequently, the method used by Xing et al produces very short estimates of gamma, even when the actual gamma signal is longer, as we show by simulating brain signals with known Gamma durations. Further, the Gamma rhythm duration estimated using this method also depends upon the window length of the STFT (Fig 1A).\n\nWe propose a matching pursuit (MP) (Mallat and Zhang, 1993; Durka et al., 2001; Chandran KS et al., 2016) based algorithm to estimate the duration of the Gamma rhythm. MP is a greedy algorithm that decomposes a time-domain signal into a linear combination of elementary waveforms called atoms. Typically, an over complete dictionary of such atoms, with both long and short durations, are available, such that the temporal support of the chosen atom depends on the structure of the signal itself: if a stable rhythm is present in the signal, an atom with a long temporal support is chosen for representation. Therefore, the statistics of the selected atoms provide a robust estimate of the duration of the rhythm, as shown through simulations (Fig 1A). We then apply this algorithm to the real brain signals and show that the median length of gamma is ~300 ms (for a visual stimulation time of 2 sec), too short to act like a reference signal (Fig 1B).",

        "text": "Skilled behavior often displays signatures of Bayesian inference. In order for the brain to implement the required computations, neuronal activity must carry accurate information about the certainty of sensory inputs. Two major approaches have been proposed to study neuronal representations of certainty. The first searches for specific properties of neuronal activity (such as tuning-curve width and maximum firing-rate) that encode certainty [1-3]. The second aims at decoding the stimulus distribution from population activity using Bayes rule [4-6]. Currently, little is understood about how these approaches compare to one another. We introduced a new model of the processing of the Interaural Time Difference (ITD) cue for stimulus location, which matches both behavioral and electrophysiological data, and makes testable experimental predictions, while closely approximating the Bayes-optimal solution to the localization task. We found that different features of neuronal activity correlated with certainty, but they did not provide an accurate estimate of certainty, indicating such neuronal correlates of certainty might not play a major role in encoding it. In contrast, the full probability distribution over ITD could be accurately reconstructed with Bayes rule from population activity, and used to estimate certainty on a trial-by-trial basis. These results suggest that uncertainty is unlikely to be encoded in a single feature of neuronal activity.",

        "text": "Comparing different models of behavior allows us to test different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. One difficulty in comparing models is that it requires testing stimuli in which the models create different predictions. Typically, stimuli selection is done non-adaptively using a predetermined fixed set of stimuli or by sampling stimuli randomly over a large range of values. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not have enough stimuli to dissociate different models and using random sampling can be inefficient. \n\nTo overcome these limitations we derived a method to dissociate psychophysical models using adaptive stimuli selection. Formally, our method selects stimuli which maximize the expected cross entropy between the current posterior probability of the different models and the posterior after the next stimuli is presented. Intuitively, this method selects stimuli so that the change in the posterior distribution is as large as possible - which is achieved by probing stimuli where the models make distinct predictions. \n\nTo test our method we considered a common model comparison used in psychophysics; a comparison of different sensory noise models. We simulated multiple ideal observers with different sensory noise models and parameters performing a 2-AFC task. The stimuli were either selected randomly or using our adaptive method. We found the number of trials required to converge to the correct model with the adaptive method was significantly lower than random sampling (requiring under half as many trials).\n\nOur technique is general and the formal basis applies to the dissociation of all Bayesian models. However, our implementation used discretized  parameter spaces and pre-computed likelihoods and is therefore particularly suited to psychophysics where the responses are binary and parameter dimensions are low. One use for our algorithm is validating sensory noise components used in more complex perception and action models. For example, consider reproducing a time interval. We can infer the most likely sensory noise model given the reproduced intervals. Our algorithm provides an efficient way to validate this inference using a psychophysical task. ",

        "text": "Introduction: \nPredictability is an important determinant for efficient coding of sensory input. We used three types of videos, which differed concerning their spatial and temporal entropies, used as measure of predictability, but also concerning their meaningfulness, to examine the contributions of different regions in processing dynamic visual information. Hippocampus, being associated with statistical extractions from the input stream (Strange et al., 2005b), could be associated with processing of predictability.\n\nMethod:\nExperiment: 27 participants (mean age 25.6¬±3.8 years, 14 females), were shown the different gray-scale videos (movements through a virtual tunnel, corresponding phase-scrambled and pixel-scrambled, i.e., white noise videos) inside the fMRI scanner and were asked to detect the occurrence of a near-threshold color cue presented briefly on the videos.\n\nEntropy calculations: To account for the temporal unfolding of the stimulus, for all the videos spatial and spatiotemporal pixel-wise and word-wise entropies were computed by dividing the videos into sliding blocks of n*n size (n*n*n for spatiotemporal entropy), where n was the word length, and computing the probabilities of each block on the frame/s.\n\nResults: \nUnivariate general linear model (p<0.05 FDR corrected): We found stronger BOLD activity in hippocampus for white noise videos (low spatial-temporal predictability) when compared to the more predictable tunnel or phase-scrambled videos. In the parahippocampus higher activity was found in response to tunnel videos as compared to noise or phase-scrambled videos. The dorsal stream also showed stronger activity for tunnel videos as compared to noise or phase-scrambled videos. \n\nMultivariate result: Partial-Least-Squares (PLS) correlations were used to examine the relationship between brain activity and entropy of the videos. The entropy timeline for each run was created and then compared with the preprocessed voxel-wise brain recordings over time for each subject. Multivariate PLS analysis showed strong positive weights bilaterally in the hippocampus for higher values of entropy (p<0.001, n = 27, T=5.6). \n\nDiscussion:\nPredictability of the visual input stream is reflected in cortical activity, and these regions, that react vigorously to it, could be associated with prediction error. Hippocampus is sensitive to probabilistic context of visual stream and hence can modulate the balancing of top-down and bottom-up sensory cortical hierarchy.",

        "text": "Synapses of cortical neurons display ongoing changes, even in the absence of an explicit learning paradigm (e.g. [1]). How does this volatility in structural connections affect the functional properties of cortical circuits? Here, we address this question in a model of population activity in mouse auditory cortex, to interpret ongoing parallel experiments employing chronic two-photon imaging in the auditory cortex of awake mice. Previous experiments found that neural population responses to brief complex sounds often cluster into a discrete set of activity patterns, which were predictive of discrimination performance and spontaneous categorization of sounds in behaving mice [2]. Such discrete representations could provide a high degree of robustness against fluctuations in synaptic strengths. Here, we use a circuit model to study the emergence of activity cluster states and their structural stability in the presence of synaptic turnover. We show that the model displays basic response properties of population activity in mouse auditory cortex, including a skewed distribution of neural firing rates and a clustering of broad sound categories into non-linear population responses. This holds over a parameter regime where recurrent connections are sufficiently heterogeneous and the network is dominated by inhibition. We use this model to study systematically the impact of synaptic turnover on collective response properties. We find that a similar response stability as observed in experiment requires changes of inhibitory synapses to be orders of magnitude slower than changes of excitatory synapses. Furthermore we find that gradual changes in the circuitry result in plateaus of stable collective response modes with abrupt transitions between them. Our model suggests that synaptic volatility may affect sensory representations in a highly nonlinear fashion.\n",

        "text": "We propose a prototype of a wearable device which aims to assist the visually impaired orienting and avoiding objects by optically finding obstacles in the nearby environment and creating acoustic warning signals. Instead of conventional cameras, the system employs two dynamic vision sensors (DVS, [1]) for visual input. DVS are biologically inspired sensors which work in a way analogous to mammal eyes: the pixels operate independently from each other and trigger so called events whenever they sense a change in brightness. This asynchronous mode of operation results in a low latency visual information (about 10 us) as well as in a low data rate: only pixels that undergo an illumination change produce data, whereas no data is generated in areas where nothing happens.\nThese properties of the DVS allow the deployment of a precise real-time depth extraction and obstacle detection algorithm which uses the combined event streams of two DVS in a stereo setup. \nThe depth information is then translated into a spatial sound at the position of each obstacle using personalized head-related transfer functions. Using such individual sounds a 3D-soundscape is generated that acoustically represents the environment to the user in an easy to interpret way [2].\nThe system requires only light-weight computation which is supposed to be ultimately done completely on-board the mobile device [3]. The envisioned assistant will allow hands-free navigation and independent orientation.",

        "text": "Recent experimental progress have made it possible to record from large populations of neurons in sensory structures. However, the high number of neurons raises a major challenge to understand how a neural network processes sensory information. A classical characterization of each single neuron only gives a fragmented view of the network processing. Probing the statistical relationship between stimuli and population responses thus requires new tools suited for the analysis of large populations of neurons.\n\nHere we developed a new method to characterize the sensitivity of a population of sensory neurons to the stimulus, and applied it to the retina. We recorded large populations of retinal output neurons (200 neurons) in rats, while presenting a randomly moving object as a visual stimulus [Field 2010, Marre 2012]. To assess the sensitivity of population coding to changes in the trajectory, we tested the impact of different stimulus perturbations on the retinal response, and searched actively for the perturbation sizes well discriminated by the retina, during the time course of the experiment (online). During these closed-loop experiments, the stimulus was modified in real time as a function of the recorded response to find the smallest perturbations that were effective at changing the population response. \n\nTo assess the discrimination capacity of the neural population from these data, we estimated the Fisher Information Matrix [Brunel 1997]. This matrix quantifies the change in the neural activity in response to stimulus perturbations. So it quantifies the network sensitivity of the neural population along any direction in the stimulus space, and it determines how strong a perturbation should be in order to be distinguished from the reference stimulus. \n\nOur results show an unexpected network sensitivity of the retinal population to high temporal frequencies of the stimulus. We are currently investigating how this network sensitivity is built up from the selectivity of individual neurons. \n\nMoreover, as can be shown by Bayesian Inversion Theorem, the network sensitivity lower-bounds the error of any stimulus decoder based on the ganglion cells response, thus allowing the evaluation of the decoder performance. As an example, we show that linear decoder [Warland 1997, Marre 2015] is not an optimal way to retrieve information about the stimulus.",

        "text": "Perception highly benefits from multisensory combination in the human brain. Bayesian Decision Theory has bestowed a revolutionary methodology to model the underlying process of multisensory and sensorimotor combination in a wide range of perceptual decision tasks [1]. Given the partially reliable sensory signals caused by a single source, a Bayesian observer estimates the state of the environment by minimizing a cost function (e.g. Mean Square Error) over the trials, and fusing noisy signals into a single estimate. But in the real world we are constantly surrounded by multiple objects and therefore by multiple sources of information. Thus besides sensor fusion, segregating information conveyed by separate sources plays a vital role in perception. For instance we never combine the sound of mewing with the picture of a dog. Taking into account all possible existing hypotheses in the environment and the problem of whether to fuse information or not involves a probabilistic process called Causal Inference [2]. It is not yet fully understood where and through which mechanism Causal Inference emerges in the brain [3]. A recent fMRI study on human performing audio-visual localization has shed some light on this problem and shows that a hierarchical distributed circuit along parietal and early sensory cortices likely performs the whole process [4]. To validate this hypothesis by using a probabilistic neural approach, we propose a distributed hierarchical circuit that can perform probabilistic Causal Inference. The proposed model can successfully reproduce human psychophysical data in audio-visual perceptual decision. When auditory and visual stimuli are largely spatially inconsistent, the fusion pathway is inhibited with higher probability, implying the fact that signals are likely caused by separate sources. The model also predicts the role of sensory likelihood, spatial discrepancy, and importantly the prior probability of the causal structure, in the spatial binding window. Basically, less uncertainty in sensory likelihood shrinks the binding window or equally sensitizes the subject to discriminate common-source or separate-sources hypothesis. In this poster, we first present an optimal neural solution for fusion and probabilistic decision. The proposed model for Causal inference basically instantiates these circuits in a parallel hierarchy. Finally we simulate and compare the behavior of the overall model with statistical generative model of human subjects.",

        "text": "For many people, the first indication they might have a hearing problem comes from difficulties they experience following conversations in background noise. Often, however, their audiogram ‚Äì the ‚Äògold-standard‚Äô test of hearing function ‚Äì indicates normal or near-normal hearing thresholds. Recently, hearing problems not evident in the audiogram have been linked to cochlear synaptopathy, a form of damage to the synaptic contact between the hair cells in the cochlea and the auditory nerve fibres (ANFs). Synaptopathy through noise exposure and ageing effectively disconnects a substantial fraction of ANFs from the hair cells (Kujawa and Liberman, 2009; Sergeyenko et al., 2013), and high-threshold ANFs ‚Äì fibres activated only by relatively loud sounds ‚Äì appear particularly vulnerable (Furman et al., 2013). Referred to colloquially as ‚Äòhidden hearing loss‚Äô (HHL), the detrimental effects of peripheral synaptopathy could contribute to tinnitus (Schaette and McAlpine, 2011) and impact on complex listening tasks such as processing speech in background noise.\n\nHere, we demonstrate in the midbrain of gerbils exposed to a single, controlled noise insult, and in human listeners, evidence of increased neural gain in the central auditory pathways, indicative of damage to high-threshold ANFs. In noise-exposed gerbils, we found that neural responses recorded from the inferior colliculus were higher than in control animals for speech stimuli at 60, but not at 75 dB SPL. Moreover, in the noise-exposed animals, discrimination performance for 60-dB SPL ‚Äòvowel-consonant-vowel‚Äô stimuli (VCVs) in background noise (speech-shaped, +12 to -12 dB signal-to-noise ratio) was higher than for 75 dB SPL VCVs, whereas in control animals the opposite relation was observed, with better performance at 75 dB SPL. A similar pattern was evident in human listeners, where a marker for HHL in the auditory brainstem response (ratio of wave V (generated by the midbrain) to wave I (generated by the auditory nerve)) showed a significant negative correlation to the change in listening performance when the intensity of the background noise was increased from 60 to 80 dB SPL. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced neural output from the cochlea at higher sound levels increases central gain through homeostatic mechanisms that seek to normalize neural activity, which could explain differences in listening performance in different levels of background noise.\n",

        "text": "Hippocampal place cells fire at a particular location within an animal's environment (place field) and are therefore thought to be crucial for successful spatial orientation and navigation. Information from multiple sensory modalities is integrated by the hippocampus in order to form an unambiguous representation of space. How exactly sensory inputs contribute to form such a neuronal place map is however unclear.\n\nTo investigate the relative contribution of visual and locotomotor inputs on place cell activity, we recorded extracellularly from the hippocampus of behaving Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Recordings were done in a virtual reality setup, while animals ran on a virtual linear corridor by rotating an air-suspended sphere. By altering the gain factor between the movement of the sphere and the speed of the visual projection on a single trial basis, we could decouple visually perceived movement from the animal's locomotion. Place cells in CA3 responded differentially to such closed loop manipulation.  One subset of place cells formed its field based on visual information within the virtual environment, independent of the distance travelled by the animal. Such visually driven place fields predominantly occur at visual texture changes within the virtual corridor.  A second subset of place cells relied predominantly on locomotor inputs, as place fields remain at the same running distance on a single trial basis, independent of the visual scene. A third subset of cells exhibited two place fields, where in most cases each field was driven by one of the two different modalities.\n\nAs a population both types of place cells formed modality-specific maps that were simultaneously represented in the hippocampus. This notion is corroborated by the fact that place field firing was adjusted on a single trial basis without adaptive processes required. Our results therefore indicate that the hippocampus preserves information from distinct processing streams to form coexisting space representations. These coexisting sensory maps could then be linked on a population level in order to form a multisensory association of spatial location or other information important to the animal.",

        "text": "The estimation of physical magnitudes, including temporal intervals, induces characteristic errors that likely result from an error minimization strategy. Such an effort to optimize estimates should take into account both external and internal influences. External factors are, for example, the range of stimulus magnitudes and stimulus modality; internal factors are, for instance, determined by an individual's discrimination abilities. To evaluate both contributions we developed a computational model that formulates magnitude estimation as two stages of noisy integration that are linked by a reference memory. This reference is iteratively built up and thereby estimates the moments of the stimulus distribution. The model reproduces characteristic properties of magnitude estimation. Most importantly, it identifies the regression effect as a means of minimizing estimation errors. With help of the model we tackle the question in how far rodents and humans use an optimal strategy to estimate temporal intervals. We performed interval timing experiments with Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) and humans and tested timing of intervals lasting several seconds. Stimuli were chosen from different ranges to modulate external influences. Based on this experimental data, we investigate in detail the dependence of interval timing on stimulus statistics and an individual's discrimination abilities.",

        "text": "Neural processing of temporal information underlies many of our cognitive abilities. Recent studies report neuronal activity correlated with interval timing in brain areas such as hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. Single neurons in those areas display a multitude of activity profiles across a stimulus interval from transiently active to monotonically increasing, or decreasing [1], and scale with changes in stimulus duration [2]. Collectively, the neurons provide a population signal encoding temporal stimuli [3]. Timing in those experiments is typically investigated with tasks that only test for specific intervals or for discrimination between two groups of intervals. Estimation on a continuum of intervals has rarely been investigated (see Ref. 4 for a study in monkeys).\nWe recorded neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) while the animals measured and reproduced temporal stimuli that were randomly chosen between 3 and 10 seconds. The animals were trained to measure the duration of a visual stimulus, and reproduce it by running for the same duration in a virtual reality. Single neurons responded differently during measurement and reproduction. While some were strongly active in only one of the task phases, others responded during both. In both task phases, the cells exhibited diverse firing patterns. Similar to previous studies we found neurons that were transiently active, or monotonically decreased or increased their firing. Responses were adapted to the particular interval presented in the current trial. \nOur findings provide the first description of how single neurons in the rodent brain contribute to measuring and reproducing temporal intervals. How these cells act together as a population will be investigated by more detailed analyses.",

        "text": "Working memory [1] storage is widely distributed across the neocortex. [2‚Äì7] Executive control of working memory storage, however, is thought to be clearly localized in lateral prefrontal cortex. [8] Here, we tested this assumption by using MVPA to trace selection-specific activity patterns which are fundamental components of control processing. In each trial, subjects successively memorized an orientation and the pitch of a tone. A retro-cue later instructed the subjects which stimulus to keep memorizing for an upcoming task. For control, each trial also included an irrelevant pseudo-cue. Importantly, we used multiple cue stimuli to instruct each possible selection (e.g. ‚ÄòA‚Äô and ‚Äò1‚Äô for ‚Äòkeep memorizing the first stimulus‚Äô) to investigate memory control independently of the cue stimulus.\n\nActivity time-courses for trials with early and late selection cues and different cued modalities clearly show that selection cues are affecting sensory stores. A univariate comparison between neural responses to selection cues versus pseudo-cues, however, reveals a wide-spread pattern of activation and deactivation with a marked exclusion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA [9‚Äì11]) furthermore show that selection-specific activity patterns that indicates which item is selected are localized to left superior temporal cortex and not the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex does however retain the order of stimulus presentation (e.g. ‚Äòvisual first‚Äô). Our results suggest that selection of a memorized item is controlled in a decentralized fashion while the prefrontal cortex provides necessary temporal order information. \n\n\n1.\tBaddeley, A.D.

        "text": "The simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks to investigate models of the brain is an ongoing challenge, as models get more and more complex and increase in size. To address this problem several neural simulators were developed, some of them being suitable for simulation of spiking neural networks on GPUs, for instance GeNN [1], CARLSim3 [2] and NCS 6 [3], showing high speedups for hundreds of thousands of neurons compared to a single-threaded CPU. ANNarchy [4] offers an equation based interface for the definition of spiking and rate-coded neural networks in Python, the latter one already supported on GPUs. ANNarchy uses a full code generation  approach, so the implementation codes can be optimized for individual models or detected hardware. In particular it is important to address load-balancing problems, e.g. due to varying amount of synaptic events. In the work presented here we show GPU-based code generation for the fast simulation of spiking neural networks in ANNarchy. We show the achieved speedups on typical benchmarks, such as the COBA [5] network and pulse-coupled networks using Izhikevich neurons using different network sizes and address limits of GPU computations.",

        "text": "Transcranial brain stimulation and evidence of ephaptic coupling have recently sparked strong interests in understanding the effects of weak electric fields on the dynamics of brain networks and of coupled populations of neurons (Reato et al. 2010 , Anastassiou et al. 2011). The collective dynamics of large neuronal populations can be efficiently studied using single-compartment (point) model neurons of the integrate-and-fire (IF) type as their elements. These models, however, lack the dendritic morphology required to biophysically describe the effect of an extracellular electric field on the neuronal membrane voltage. Here, we extend the IF point neuron models to accurately reflect morphology dependent electric field effects extracted from a canonical spatial ``ball-and-stick'' (BS) neuron model. Even in the absence of an extracellular field, neuronal morphology by itself strongly affects the cellular response properties (Ostojic et al 2015). We, therefore, derive additional components for leaky and nonlinear IF neuron models to reproduce the subthreshold voltage and spiking dynamics of the BS model exposed to both fluctuating somatic and dendritic inputs and an extracellular electric field. We show that an oscillatory electric field causes spike rate resonance, or equivalently, pronounced spike to field coherence. Its resonance frequency depends on the location of the synaptic background inputs. For somatic inputs the resonance appears in the beta and gamma frequency range, whereas for distal dendritic inputs it is shifted to even higher frequencies. Irrespective of an external electric field, the presence of a dendritic cable attenuates the subthreshold response at the soma to slowly-varying somatic inputs while implementing a low-pass filter for distal dendritic inputs. Our point neuron model extension is straightforward to implement and is computationally much more efficient compared to the original BS model. It is well suited for studying the dynamics of large populations of neurons with heterogeneous dendritic morphology with (and without) the influence of weak external electric fields.",

        "text": "Normal neural population activity and information encoding in the hippocampus can be modeled with ring attractors dynamics[1], but this representation has not yet been linked to pathological hippocampus activity such as temporal lobe epileptic seizures.\nIn this study, we wanted to investigate under which conditions these dynamic models can develop oscillatory activities characteristic of the temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we focused on the influence of the synaptic connectivity[2][3]. We performed the analysis of networks consisting in one or two rings of excitatory or inhibitory rate model neurons with piece-wise linear activation functions and spatially symmetric synaptic connections. We evaluated their stability under constant input current considering either the role of the real/complex eigenvalues of the system or the role of the switches dues to the nonlinearity of its activation functions. \nOur main results are that : (1) single-ring networks cannot oscillate, neither due to their eigenvalues nor due the nonlinearity of their activation functions, and (2) two-ring networks have more complex dynamics that enable them to exhibit either normal or pathological activity, depending on their connectivity. In particular, switches proveoked by the nonllinear activation functions can cause these systems to present a limit cycle.  \nWe then verified our predictions using network simulations, for different synaptic connection range and different input levels. In the case of two-ring networks, we observed that networks with only short-range synaptic connections were stable for all inputs, thus describing  healthy hippocampus activity, whereas networks with unbalanced connections could oscillate for certain input levels, while remaining stable for others, thus representing plausible epileptic networks.\n",

        "text": "By means of which 'code' do neuronal networks represent and propagate information accumulated about prior inputs? We investigated necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-organized emergence of rank-order-based coding schemes, such that input information is encoded in the spike order of a certain subset of privileged neurons. Such schemes provide a natural way to concisely represent and readily propagate information within and between networks.\nAs a sufficient condition, we present an unstructured network of leaky integrate-and-fire units, sparsely and randomly connected by dynamical conductance synapses. Such a recurrent network expresses privileged neurons ('pioneer neurons'), whose discharge order represents up to 90 % of the input information received prior to a spontaneous synchronization event (‚Äònetwork spike‚Äô). As a necessary condition, we identify a certain degree of heterogeneity of (random) connectivity. Fully homogeneous random (Erd√∂s-R√©nyi) networks express only few ‚Äòpioneer neurons‚Äô. We demonstrate this by analytically predicting spike latencies in arbitrary recurrent networks, given only connection topology and neuron and synapse parameters. This in turn determines the number of ‚Äòpioneer neurons‚Äô and the amount of information represented prior to a synchronization event. Our results underline the functional importance of network heterogeneity, complementing other properties that have received more attention in the literature (small-worldness, scale-freeness, or hub-richness).\nFurther studies of modular networks with heterogeneous modules demonstrate that the information encoded by ‚Äòpioneer neurons‚Äô is readily propagated between modules.",

It describes the fast dynamics of the neuronal membrane voltage influenced by slowly decaying potassium currents which cause spike-rate adaptation. Assuming that the timescales of these two dynamics are separable, an infinitely large population of aEIF neurons subject to fluctuating synaptic inputs can be described deterministically in terms of the time-varying probability density of its membrane voltage using the Fokker-Planck equation complemented by a non-standard reinjection mechanism [2,3]. In order to capture dynamical features exclusively present in populations of (realistic) finite size, so called finite-size effects, this approach needs to be extended.\nIn this work, we first present a numerical scheme based on a finite volume method that efficiently solves the Fokker-Planck equation for infinitely large populations. Subsequently, in order to model finite-size effects, the equation is extended by a stochastic source term which acts on the reinjection mechanism [4].  Finally, the reproduction accuracy of the developed method is evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations, showing that it is able to reproduce spike-rate distributions and non-trivial patterns in the power-spectra of spike-rate time series. We further discuss how the method can give valuable insights into the role of finite-size noise for the switching behavior between different stable network states.\n",

        "text": "Dendritic trees are easily identified by eye, but the precise set of features that make them so recognisable is generally not quite so obvious. The analysis of branching statistics has  been developed to quantify the complex morphology of a dendritic tree and permit categorisation [1]. Previous studies have found extensive correlations between different branching parameters; but have often been constrained by relatively sparse data, limited to a few classes of cell. In addition, it is not at all clear which parameters are most important across the full range of cell classes. We take a new approach, using the insights gained from generative models of synthetic dendrites [2] to analytically develop new branching metrics and catalogue their relationships and dependencies. We are able to investigate how much dendritic structure arises as a function of connectivity, finding that the majority of morphological characteristics are related closely to a cell‚Äôs inputs. A large number of neuronal classes can therefore be defined by the volume that their dendrites span, with geometrically regular areas approximating these well. This work, alongside the new tools presented in parallel that allow easy manipulation of the entire NeuroMorpho.org database [3], will enable us to rigorously define a new framework to discuss dendritic morphology.",

        "text": "Spikes in sensory neurons results from the integration of a time-ordered stimulus and the contribution of pre-synaptic neurons in the network. These spikes are conveyed collectively to the cortex using correlated  (in space and time) patterns of spikes that constitute the ‚Äúneural code‚Äù. Since spikes patterns occur irregularly, but highly structured, both within and over repeated trials of stimuli, it is appropriate to characterize them using probabilistic descriptions or statistical models. To analyze the spike train statistics, there has been two mayor approaches: The maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) and Neuronal network modeling.\n\nMaxEnt models have been extensively used to try and explain statistics of spike trains in experimental data. Although they are usually constrained by the hypothesis of stationarity and usually limited to synchronous pairwise interactions, far more general extensions exist under the name of Gibbs distributions. Gibbs distributions afford time-delayed interactions (i.e. they allow to handle memory and causality) [1,2], non stationarity, n-neurons interactions; they even allow conditioning upon the future (closely related to the notion of anticipation). However, the classical formulation of Gibbs distribution with a potential summing all possible interactions leads rapidly to an exponentially increasing number of terms, intractable on numerical and practical grounds. In this poster we show that this approach, relying upon statistical physics and thermodynamics wisdom is not optimal. On the opposite, as we show, classical neuronal networks model, such the leaky-integrate and fire with a time dependent stimulus, exhibit a closed form potential, which is an explicit non linear function of synaptic weights and stimulus [3].  This potential can be expressed in the usual form of a sum of n-neurons interactions, but, as we show, the corresponding¬† coefficients are non linear functions of the synaptic weights and stimulus. Thus, the classical sumation of interactions, on which MaxEnt model is grounded, leads to a plethora of redundant terms and a huge and artificial spread of dimensionality. Moreover, e.g. pairwise interactions are not easily related to synaptic interactions, as they also depend on the stimulus [4]. Additionally, it allows to anticipate the effects of slight variations in the stimulus (which can be time dependent) on the spike correlations, using linear response theory.¬†",

        "text": "The use of whole-brain networks for understanding the dynamics of the interaction between brain regions has experienced a rise in popularity in the last few years. Here, we calibrate a whole-brain network model to human resting state data, and use it to explore the effects of weak electric fields on the network dynamics.\n\nThe structural connectivity of the brain network is extracted from parcellated brain scans using an atlas with 68 regions (Desikan et al., 2006) and DTI tractography of long-range axons to estimate coupling strengths and delays between regions averaged over 48 individuals (Ritter et al. 2013, Schirner et al. 2015). The mean activity of each brain region is described by a mean-field population model of EIF neurons (Ladenbauer, 2015). After fitting local parameters such as recurrent coupling strengths and delays and the global parameters coupling strength, axonal signal transmission speed and external noise intensity, our model can produce simulated BOLD functional connectivity (FC) with high Pearson correlation (mean .55, max/min .78/.25) to the empirical 20 minute resting state BOLD FC of these individuals. A local model with a limit cycle at gamma frequencies and a bistability with a low and a high-activity fixed point was found to produce good fits.\n\nA range of global parameters can produce good grand average FC fits. However, the FC in the resting state is not stationary. To capture the brain's dynamical properties in the resting state, the FC fit is complemented by a fit of the FCD matrix (Hansen et al, 2015). We show that the simulated FCD matrix is well comparable to empirical data (Kolmogorov distance around 0.1) on several timescales. Clustering of the power spectra of the local nodes shows that nodes of the brain graph can be divided into two sets with dominant alpha and gamma frequencies respectively and that contralateral regions end up in the same cluster.\n\nLastly, we present results of modeling the effect of external tACS-like brain stimulation on the global network activity. By modifying the dynamics of a subset of nodes, the global dynamics of the brain network can be shaped. We stimulate the bilateral entorhinal cortices, the main interface of the cortex to Hippocampus. We show that on the global network level, transitions from a DOWN state to an UP state tend to lock on the onset of oscillatory stimulation and relate these results to experimental findings in the rat brain conducted in Ref. (Battaglia et al, 2004).",

A remarkably reproducible default mode with a low degree of complexity which opens a window on the brain multiscale organization, on top of which cognitive functions emerge during wakefulness. Understanding how such transition takes place starting from the characterization of a stereotyped state like the slow-wave activity [1], might shade light on the emergence of the rich repertoire of neuronal dynamics underlying brain computation. Sleep-wake transition is a widely studied phenomenon [2], however it is still debated how brain state changes occur. Here we show from intracortical recordings in anesthetized rats, that sleep-like rhythms fade out when wakefulness is approached giving rise to an alternation between slow Up/Down oscillations and awake-like activity periods. This phase of activity pattern bistability is captured by a mean-field rate-based model of a cortical column, in which for a transient range of anesthesia levels the coexistence of two metastable attractor states emerges. Alternation between these two states is granted by the ongoing competition of local features and exogenous modulations governing both the excitability and the fatigue level of the modeled column. Our results highlight a brain state transition which is not a continuous smooth change but rather a progressive modulation of the stability of two coexistent activity regimes, which in turn leave different fingerprints across cortical columns. Guided by this mean-field model, spiking neuron networks are devised to reproduce the electrophysiological changes displayed during the transition.",

        "text": "Spontaneous activity in visual cortex has been found to resemble the spatially organized responses to oriented stimuli [1]. We wondered if and how this finding can be reconciled with the hypothesis that cortex mainly performs optimal inference [2-4]. The latter is based on the idea that the brain organizes sensory information into an efficient representation of the outside world: neurons receive noisy and unreliable inputs, accumulate evidence over time and compete with each other to build sparse representations of the stimuli.\nThis would be equivalent to inferring the most probable features of the stimulus that may cause an input from sensory neurons, while minimizing a sparsity measure. Models of visual cortex developed within this framework [3, 4] use features that are localized in space. As a consequence, they are not able to account for the spatial correlations and high-order statistics of natural images.\nWe propose a spiking network that extends the architecture of these models, by combining it with a term that links different locations of the visual space in an associative manner. In our model each hyper-column implements a sparse coding module [2] that alone would produce an optimal local representation of the stimulus. These representations are then interacting with all other hyper-columns via long range connections. In particular, similar orientations are positively coupled so that evidence of a cause in one location provides evidence of the same cause in others. The model maintains its optimal inference property, building robust representations of visual scenes from the information contained in localized image patches, thereby exploiting prior knowledge about spatial correlations in natural scenes.\nWithout external input and driven only with noise, the system exhibits a spontaneous dynamics highly structured in space and time. Activity patterns that closely resemble orientation maps emerge, as observed in [1]: when a cortical state occurs, it spans different hyper-columns and switching between states is continuous, i.e. activity patterns close in time correspond to similar orientations. While reproducing the experimental findings, the network maintains low firing rates and large variability typical of spontaneous activity.\nIn the future, this will allows us to explore and quantify the impact of electrical stimulation (e.g. for visual cortex prosthesis) on a cortical network and to investigate its interaction with information processing.",

        "text": "Synaptic interactions fundamentally underly the dynamics and function of neural circuits. Advances in multi-unit and multi-neuron monitoring technologies stimulated the development of frameworks to infer connectivity from recordings of spiking activity. Yet, existing frameworks either identify functional or causal interactions among neurons [1, 2] that often disagree with synaptic connections, or rely on assumptions on the underlying nonlinear dynamics that are hardly known beforehand [3, 4, 5, 6].\nHere, we propose a model independent approach for inferring synaptic connectivity of neural networks from spike trains alone. By introducing a mapping from the time series representation of neural recordings to high-dimensional event spaces, we successfully recover the synaptic connections. We thereby uniquely identify the incoming synaptic connectivity of each observed neuron, capturing also whether they are excitatory or inhibitory. Furthermore, we recover approximate delay times by an optimisation in the space of delays. These results suggest that synaptic connectivity and interaction delays may be effectively recovered from multiple spike train recordings alone.  ",

        "text": "Recently, many research groups have focused on the inference of networks from data such as brain networks from observed electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging data. In the example of the brain, this promises to disclose information about how the brain processes signals and how alterations thereof cause specific diseases. A key hypothesis is that important characteristics are not specific to individual subjects but rather common in a given population. This is reflected by the fact that brain networks but also other networks are typically classi\fed into main prototypic networks, i.e., Erdos-Renyi, Small World and Scale Free Networks.\nIn the Inverse Problem, the challenge is to infer the network topology from data. Two challenges are particularly relevant: (i) to reliably obtain the links in the network once the nodes have been fixed, (ii) to use the characteristics above to uniquely determine the type of network. For oscillatory systems several cutting-edge methods have been suggested in the literature to address problem (i). Usually these techniques rely on statistical inference. The correct reconstruction of networks is therefore hampered by mis-estimation of links due to statistical uncertainties, unobserved processes, noise contamination to name just a few. Mis-estimated links in a network typically alter the key characteristics; this makes it particularly difficult to infer the correct type of network and it is the challenge of problem (ii).\nWe investigate to which extent classical statistical approaches to estimate links in a network are reliable; furthermore, we investigate if common rules of type I and type II errors should be modi\fed to achieve a reliable inference of the correct type of network. Our approach is based on the topological analysis of the detected networks taking into account the role of two important parameters: false positive and false negative decisions about the presence and absence of links.\nWe present simulation results which indicate that standard alpha values for statistical inference are suboptimal when for instance the vertex degree distribution is to be estimated. We suggest a novel procedure to optimally balance false positive and negative conclusions. This enables us to obtain, e.g., the best estimate for the average shortest path length or degree distribution for a given analysis technique.",

We analyse in detail appearance and stability properties of this state in possibly the simplest setup of a biharmonic Kuramoto-Daido phase model as well as demonstrate the effect in limit-cycle relaxational Rayleigh oscillators. Such a regime extends the notion of splay state from an uniform distribution of phases to an oscillating one. The inhomogeneity of the distribution can be detected as a non-zero macroscopic mean field. The characteristic and most peculiar property of partial synchrony is the difference between the frequencies of single units and that of the macroscopic field.",

        "text": "A single neuron is categorized as \"multisensory'' if there is a statistically significant difference between the response evoked by a cross-modal stimulus combination and that evoked by the most effective of its components individually. The most widely applied quantitative index expresses multisensory enhancement (or inhibition) as a proportion of the strongest unisensory response. However, it has no theoretical foundation in terms of the possible operations a neuron may perform in combining unisensory inputs to yield the multisensory response. In particular, being responsive to multiple sensory modalities does not guarantee that a neuron has actually engaged in integrating its multiple sensory inputs rather than simply responding to the most salient stimulus. Here, a new index is proposed based on a (maximal negatively) dependent probability summation mechanism. It compares the mean observed cross-modal response of a neuron, defined as the absolute number of spikes within a time interval after stimulus presentation,  with the largest cross-modal mean achievable by stochastically coupling its unisensory responses. Because this new measure is, in general, more restrictive than the traditional one, many neurons previously categorized as \"multisensory'' may possibly lose that property. The approach is illustrated by data from 27 recording sessions of cat superior colliculus neurons. A significant difference (bootstrapped confidence intervals) was found in all but four of the sessions. Computation of the new index is straightforward and it is as amenable to statistical testing as the traditional one. The new measure is applicable to multisensory neurons of any kind. The same logic of finding a benchmark can be applied to the ‚Äúadditive model‚Äù, predicting the largest achievable sum of the unimodal responses. Moreover, it is completely analogous to a widely-used procedure in behavioral studies of multisensory integration (\"race model inequality''). Possible extension to more complex structures is also discussed.",

        "text": "Synaptic kinetics is known to play a central role in the generation of oscillations in networks of inhibitory in-terneurons. A large body of computational work has shown that inhibitory networks of spiking neurons with synaptic kinetics generate oscillations in the gamma range via collective synchronization [1-4]. This neuronal mechanism is commonly referred to as ING (interneuronal gamma). Interestingly, these collective oscillations disappear for broad enough distributions of heterogeneity.\nHere we thoroughly analyze the emergence of collective synchronization via the ING mechanism by means of a novel firing rate model with first order synaptic kinetics (FRM). This three dimensional FRM is exactly derived form a network of quadratic integrate and fire neurons and, in sharp contrast with heuristic firing rate models, it is capable to describe states with spike synchronization [5]. Linear stability analysis of the FRM shows that the asynchronous state loses stability at a (supercritical) Hopf bifurcation, leading to a partially synchronized state. The Hopf stability boundaries are analytically obtained, and reveal a closed region in parameter space where ING oscillations are observed. Consistent with previous numerical studies [1-3], collective synchronization is observed for intermediate values of the ratio of synaptic and membrane time constants, and for intermediate values of the inhibitory coupling. The region of oscillations progressively shrinks as the degree of heterogeneity is increased, and ceases to exist beyond a precise value of the quenched disorder. The results remain qualitatively the same considering second order synaptic kinetics, i.e. alpha synapses.",

        "text": "To better understand the relationship between connectivity and function in the brain at different scales, in this work we show the results of using point-neuron network simulations to complement connectivity information from whole brain simulations based on a dynamic neuron mass model. In our multiscale approach, we simulate a whole brain parcellated into 68 regions using a setup similar to that described in Deco et al. 2014 [1]. Each region is modeled as a dynamic neuron mass, and in parallel, we also model each region as small point-neuron populations in NEST [2]. Structural plasticity in NEST is then used to calculate the inner  inhibitory connectivity required to match experimentally observed firing-rate behavior. An interactive tool was developed for steering the structural plasticity algorithm and bring all regions, which are also highly interconnected, to their ideal firing activity. An inner inhibition fitting was first proposed in the work by Deco et al. [1] using an iterative tuning method. In our work, we allow the point-neuron network to self-generate the connectivity using simple homeostatic rules and then we feed this information to the dynamic mass model simulation. With the resulting connectivity data from the NEST simulations and experimentally obtained DTI inter-region connectivity, simulations of the whole brain producing results comparable to experimental fMRI data are possible. Using this approach, the fitting and parameter space exploration times are reduced and a new way to explore the impact of connectivity in function at different scales is presented.",

        "text": "How a population of neurons encodes a signal -- sensory or internal -- is strongly influenced by the activity in other populations. The response of a primary sensory cortex to a bottom-up signal, for instance, is dependent on the top-down input it receives from higher cortical areas. This activity, which is not related to the signal in question, constitutes a background that shapes information transmission.  Background activity varies with the so-called brain state: while for attentive states, asynchronous activity has been reported, it becomes more synchronized during quiet wakefulness and slow-wave sleep, where collective periods of spiking (up states) are interspersed with silent periods (down states).\n\nWe study the transmission of a signal by an uncoupled population of leaky-integrate-and fire neurons that are subject to input from a background population. This background is either in an asynchronous regime, in which the firing rate is constant, or undergoes up-down transitions which are modeled by imposing a common backround rate that switches stochastically between high and low values. Our principal finding, obtained through extensive numerical simulations as well as novel analytical approximations, is the following: If the mean background rate is low, more information about the signal is transmitted with an up-down background. We demonstrate that this effect also occurs in a more realistic recurrent network and is robust with respect to the statistics of the up-down switching. Finally, we incorporate into our model that up states, in general, propagate across cortex as traveling waves. We find that this further enhances information transmission and also allows nearly continuous signal transmission.\n\nIt has been suggested that the functional role of such up-down regimes lies in the overall reduction in firing rates caused by the down states, which is thought to be important for cellular regeneration [1]. This raises the question why such a reduction is not instead achieved in a manner that maintains asynchronous firing. In this work, we propose that the answer may lie in the consequences the respective regimes have for information transmission: At reduced background rates, redistributing the spikes into up states maintains at least some information transmission capabilities.",

        "text": "Neurons express a large variability in the morphology of their dendritic trees and dendrite morphology is known to affect neuronal dynamics and function. This variability is prominently seen across cell types, but even across cells of the same class ‚Äì no two cells are the same. Thus a number of statistics of dendritic trees were devised (for an overview see e.g. Scorcioni et al, 2008) that are commonly used to compare and distinguish cells and cell classes. \n\nHere we investigate a number of such statistics using a large sample of reconstructions of real dendritic trees from the NeuroMorpho.org database (Ascoli et al., 2007) containing reconstructions of a wide range of species, brain regions and cell types, as well as reconstructions of mouse neurons taken from the Allen Atlas (Sunkin et al., 2013). To maximize the validity of our conclusions, all reconstructions were manually inspected and reconstructions of low quality were discarded. In particular, we investigate for the first time the relations between statistics of both the geometry and the topology (i.e branching structure) of dendritic trees on such a comprehensive data set and identify interdependencies and scaling laws for the statistics holding across species and cell types.\n\nThe analyses were performed using a forthcoming version 2 of the TREES toolbox in Matlab (Cuntz et al., 2010) that greatly facilitates the analysis of populations of dendritic trees and allows to access the NeuroMorpho.org and Allen Atlas data bases directly from the Matlab command line using a newly developed software interface (API). In cooperation with the NeuroMorpho.org team we plan to soon make this API publicly available and thus allow other software to direcly access the full NeuroMorpho.org data set using a convenient query language.\n\nReferences\n\nAscoli, G.

        "text": "How a cortical neuron responds to sensory stimuli is shaped by the activity of its thalamic afferents as well as the short-term dynamics at the thalamocortical (TC) synapses. TC synapses have been shown to be chronically depressed in vivo [1]. However, a recent study revealed that even while being in a depressed state, TC synapses can undergo diverse forms of further short-term plasticity, including facilitation [2]. It remains unclear how these complex synaptic dynamics affect the responses of the target cortical neurons. In this study, we used the NEURON simulation environment to investigate the response properties of cortical cells with different forms of synaptic organizations consistent with the observed synaptic diversity. We found that cells with homogeneous synapse dynamics (i.e. inter-neuron synapse diversity) could be differentially modulated not only by the average firing rate, but also by the temporal pattern of thalamic spike trains. Cells with heterogeneous synapse dynamics (i.e. intra-neuron synapse diversity) showed considerable differences in activity, depending on how well the dynamics of single synapses matched the average firing rates of single thalamic afferents. These results indicate that the short-term dynamics of TC synapses could modify the response properties of cortical cells with respect to information encoded in the temporal structure of thalamic spike trains. Our simulations suggest possible experiments that could lead to a better understanding of how TC synapse plasticity shapes cortical responses to sensory stimulation.",

        "text": "The processing and analysis of natural scenes requires the visual system to integrate localized, distributed image features into global, coherent percepts. A central hypothesis states that our brain uses statistical dependencies in visual scenes: when represented in neural interactions between elementary feature detectors, they will enhance the processing of certain feature conjunctions, while suppressing others. As a neural mechanism realizing these modulatory effects, pairwise interactions between feature detectors in early visual areas have been proposed.\nBy combining psychophysical experiments with computational modeling and image analysis, we investigated which interaction structures underlie feature integration in visual cortex, and how perception and neural interactions relate to natural scene statistics. \nAs stimuli we used grating patch configurations (plaids) comprising four patches with varying orientations (45¬∞ / -45¬∞), spatial frequencies (low / high), and inter-patch distances (1¬∞ / 2¬∞ of visual angle). \nHuman detection thresholds for plaids were strongly modulated by inter-patch distance, number of orientation- and frequency-aligned patches and spatial frequency content (low, high, mixed). \nUsing a structurally simplistic cortical model comprising orientation columns connected by horizontal axons, we were able to reproduce detection thresholds for all configurations quantitatively. The model consists of 4x4 neural populations, representing all patch configurations per position. Interaction strengths were initialized randomly and optimized by a stochastic gradient descent. We used two approaches, namely (A) having no restrictions on the weight matrix for allowing a maximum number of degrees of freedom (DOF), and (B) imposing a connection structure mirroring physiological and psychophysical evidence with a small number of DOFs. Both approaches yield similar results:  In addition to medium-range inhibition and long-range, orientation-specific excitation, model and experiment predict a novel form of strong orientation-specific, inhibitory interactions between different spatial frequencies. \nFor large inter-patch distances, detection thresholds for the plaids were inversely related to their likelihood of occurrence in natural images. However, for small inter-patch distances, natural image statistics can not explain psychophysics, hence suggesting a different functional role of the suppressive interactions observed for small inter-patch distances.",

        "text": "The mechanisms of neural encoding, storing and retrieving information are intensively under research. Especially, cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying the dynamics of neurotransmitter release may play a critical role in these processes. In response to high levels of input into neural systems, the firing rate of neural populations may increase and it can in turn also lead to an increase in the firing rate of efferent neural areas. In order to control the level of neural activity, neurons are equipped with molecular and synaptic mechanisms like inhibitory neurons. In this work, we have developed a novel hypothesis explaining the mechanism of controlling neurotransmitter release at different levels of stimulation of neural systems. For this purpose we modelled a fast diffused retrograde signalling in dendrites. The results show the efficiency of designed neural network equipped with retrograde signalling based mechanism that is able to encode different stimulus intensities. The optimal values of dynamical parameters were investigated and used in encoding tasks. The results show high levels of encoding efficiency by applying these optimal values to detect and discriminate pairs of similar intensity of stimuli. This work suggests applying simplified molecular mechanism in the neurons for developing efficient neural systems to perform cognitive and behavioral tasks.",

        "text": "Networks of spiking neurons in the balanced state provide a prototype of complex recurrent interactions in biological networks which may give rise to self-generate intrinsic fluctuations. For instance,  an approximate balance between the excitatory and inhibitory input in cortical models introduces fluctuations that can explain the temporal irregular activity in the cortex [1]. Generally, the asymptotic analysis of these networks requires the assumption of the homogeneous randomness of neural connectivity. However, nonrandom and inhomogeneous features of synaptic connectivity are highly presented in local cortical circuits [2]. Here, we derive a unified mean-field theory (MFT) for a recurrent network of binary units with arbitrary connectivity architecture. We identified conditions on the connectivity patterns in which the MFT converges to a deterministic limit. Interestingly, our theory formally extends to both networks with sparse [1] and dense coupling [3] schemes. The mathematical analysis using martingale structures of Markovian dynamics further quantify the aggregate fluctuation of the population firing rate given the system size. We show that for homogeneous networks the diffusion term in the mean-field equation will vanish in the thermodynamical limits. \n\nWe additionally explore the scope of applicability of the MFT under which it does not show a   point-wise convergence. In particular, we investigate a novel dynamical state that the asynchronous spiking of a subset of neurons may lead to stochastic synchronization in the network. This  stochastic synchronization directly results from inhomogeneous coupling micro-structures in the network. This phenomenon resembles non-trivial fluctuations in the average population firing rate which can survive irrespective of the network size. The concise analysis here enables us to represent the mean-field equation for these cases in a form of a stochastic ordinary differential equation.  Our results indicate the essential ingredient for  implementation of connectivity motives such as synfire chains [4] in the general theory of recurrent networks in the balanced state.",

        "text": "Mouse striatal projection neurons (SPNs) recorded under ketamine anesthesia exhibit transitions between depolarized and hyperpolarized membrane potentials known as up- and down-states respectively. It is presumed that the activity during down-states is determined by intracellular processes, whereas the large membrane voltage fluctuations during up-states are a product of increased synaptic input. Because local striatal activity during an up-state is weak, the statistics of the up-state fluctuations mainly reflect cortical feedforward input to the SPNs.\n\nTo infer the statistics of the cortical input to SPNs we measured the statistics and spectrum of the membrane potential of SPNs in up- and down-states. The spectrum of the membrane potential reflects the filtering properties of the membrane and can be used to estimate the effective time constant (œÑeff) of the neuron. Our analysis showed that most of the recorded SPNs have significantly smaller œÑeff in the up-state than in the down-state, consistent with the assumption that the barrage of synaptic input causes an increase in membrane conductance during the up-state [1].\n\nWe demonstrate that the means (Œº) of the membrane potential during up-states and their variance in the high-gamma band (œÉ) varied in a correlated manner (œÅ). Using a point neuron model of an SPN and a simplified representation of the cortico-striatal network, we show that this effect in the up-states could be explained if we assume that SPNs receive correlated inputs. \n\nAcross different SPNs we observed high variability in the correlation (œÅ) between Œº and œÉ. This variability could arise from the heterogeneity in the neuron morphology, intracellular properties, conductance state of the neurons, synaptic weights and the input rate and correlations. Using a point neuron model, we tested the dependence of œÅ on each of these properties. Our analysis showed that the chief factor determining variability of the correlation between Œº and œÉ is the diversity of synaptic weights and input correlations, and that most of the intrinsic properties of SPNs have little, to no effect. This suggests that neuronal heterogeneity could be obscured by the statistics of the synaptic inputs and synaptic weights.\n\nIn summary, our analysis allows us to make general inferences about characteristics of correlated synaptic input, such as strength of correlations and input firing rate, based solely on membrane potential recordings of SPNs exhibiting up- and down-states.",

        "text": "Neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective for the orientation of light/dark edges in their receptive fields [1]. In primates and carnivores the preferred orientation of the neurons changes systematically across the cortical surface forming iso-orientation domains ordered around point-like topological defects called pinwheel centers [2]. It is a long standing theoretical prediction that visual cortical circuits are in a state of flux, such that the preferred orientation of the neurons represents a non-equilibrium steady state of circuit turnover [3]. If this prediction is true and multiple steady states coexist, then signatures of the underlying dynamical process should be observable as a rearrangement of the domains over time.\n\nWe tested this hypothesis by investigating the occurrence of the largest topological change conceivable in the layout: the generation and annihilation of pinwheel pairs. We conducted acute high accuracy large scale intrinsic signal imaging experiments in 30 ferrets. In 24 of the ferrets we further employed an adapted pairing protocol [4] between imaging sessions to  drive the cortical circuits out of a potential stationary state. To harvest significant topological changes we quantified the certainty of the measurements using re-sampling methods. The probability of pinwheel existence was calculated by tracking their position between bootstrap samples. The accuracy of the estimated orientation preference of individual pixels was computed from their inter-sample tuning distribution. We analyzed the dynamics of 2620 pinwheels by comparing the measured layouts in subsequent imaging sessions of 42 minutes each.\n\nUsing this extensive data set and precise analysis methods we found rare but conclusive examples of pinwheel rearrangement. The rate of these events was increased when the pairing paradigm was used. These results demonstrate for the first time dynamical changes of visual cortical architecture driven by neuronal activity.\n",

        "text": "Recent theoretical work suggests that heterogeneity of neuronal populations may substantially increase amount of information captured by the nervous system about sensory stimuli [1 ‚Äì 4]. Shannon's mutual information (MI) provides a proper framework for considering this problem. However, evaluation and maximization of MI are technically challenging. Properties of encoding-optimal tuning curves (TCs) of single neurons described by Poisson statistics were thoroughly analyzed [3]. The results were extrapolated to predict the population level properties by combining responses of all neurons into one effective Poisson channel. Other studies exploited the approximation of the limit of large neuron number for this task [4]. It is, however, not fully understood how well these simplifications apply to realistic, finite size systems.\n\nHere, we present results of numerical studies of the TC heterogeneity of MI-maximizing, finite size populations of independent neurons driven by a common stimulus. In the model, each neuron exhibits Poisson spike statistics and a monotonically increasing spike rate dependence on the stimulus intensity. Responses to static stimuli of fixed duration are considered.\n\nOur results suggest that, like for a single Poisson neuron, MI-maximizing TCs are discrete for a set of independent neurons. Likewise, we find that the structure of optimal TCs changes with decreased output noise through a series of bifurcations. However, at any noise level considered, optimal MI increases with the maximal number of neuron subpopulations in the later case. This is in contrast to the situation of the lumped-population Poisson channel, when, at a given level of the output noise, MI is maximized by a population with a finite number of different TCs. Moreover, it turns out that the combination of independent neurons into one effective unit may substantially reduce the achievable MI.\n\nNext, we find that the above results also apply to a more physiological situation of continuous TCs with finite dynamic ranges except that the optimal number of neuronal subpopulations is finite at a given level of output noise then. The exact heterogeneity structure, described by the sizes of different subpopulations and the parameters of their TCs, strongly depends on the output noise level. This opposes the prediction of the approximation of large neuron number, which anticipates the same heterogeneity structure of the population independent of the intensity of the output noise.",

        "text": "The description of the correlated activity of large populations of neurons is essential to understand how the brain performs computations and encodes sensory information. Nevertheless, how to simply capture these correlations is still a matter of debate. Recent studies have shown that the activity of each cell is influenced by the population rate (Okun et al., 2015), defined as the summed activity of all neurons in the population. However, an explicit model for these interactions is still lacking.\n\nHere we build a probabilistic model of population activity that reproduces the dependency between each cell and the population rate. Unlike other models of population activity, such as those reproducing couplings between pairs of neurons, this model is tractable, meaning that its predictions can be computed analytically. As a consequence, this model can then be learned in a few seconds on a standard computer, even for large population recordings. \n\nWe inferred our model for a population of 160 neurons in the salamander retina. In this population, we uncovered new dependencies on the population rate that do not fit within the proposed division between soloists and choristers (Okun et al. 2015). In particular, a majority of cells were tuned to a preferred population rate at which they were most likely to fire, rather than being monotonically coupled to the population. These complex dependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and the population rate. Overall, we found that population couplings had a similar predictive performance in the retina than what was found in the cortex.\n\nWe thus provide a simple and computationally tractable way to model the dependence of each neuron on the population rate. The procedure is general and can be applied to any recording of  spike trains within large populations.",

        "text": "Functionally equivalent neuronal circuits can generate similar activity patterns despite disparate intrinsic and synaptic properties. Neuromodulators can alter these properties, by reconfiguring circuits and producing multiple behavioral outputs. One example is provided by the stomatogastric nervous system of crustaceans, where projection neuron MCN1 activates the circuit of interneurons LG and Int1 coupled by recurrent inhibition. In this circuit, activation of an entire projection neuron population produces different activity patterns in comparison to an ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù activation of a subset of that population. We seek to uncover the interplay between circuit properties (intrinsic and synaptic) by examining circuit output to descending stimuli with different correlation structure. We use conductance-based models to investigate the role of descending inputs in regulating the output of small circuits comprised of two mutually inhibitory non-identical neurons. Using reduction methods from dynamical systems, high-dimensional conductance-based models are reduced based on quasi-steady state analysis, achieving timescale separation into three timescales corresponding to the upstroke of an action potential, the membrane potential repolarization following a spike and the interburst interval. The synaptic time constants further interact with the neurons‚Äô intrinsic time constants, and allow us to relate circuit output to the circuit‚Äôs low-dimensional description. We discuss robustness of circuit output in response to stimuli with different statistics in the context of trade-offs between synaptic and intrinsic properties, which has implications for neuromodulation and plasticity that can dynamically change these properties.

        "text": "Networks of randomly coupled rate neurons display a transition to chaos at a critical coupling strength [1]. These networks exhibit optimal information processing capabilities close to the transition ‚Äì at the edge of chaos ‚Äì and have been a focus both in neuroscience and machine learning. In the absence of noise or time-dependent inputs the transition is well understood by a dynamical mean-field theory describing the fluctuations of a single unit [1]. In particular, the transition to chaos occurs exactly when the trivial fixed point becomes unstable and hence can be predicted by linear stability analysis. Moreover, chaos is uniquely indicated by a decaying autocorrelation function. However, in nature and technology, these networks operate in the presence of noise or time-dependent inputs, rendering their dynamics stochastic or nonautonomous.\n\nPreviously it was found that noise shifts the transition to chaos to larger coupling strengths in simpler discrete-time systems [2], where the critical coupling corresponds to the point at which the system becomes locally unstable. The absence of temporal correlations on the one hand greatly simplifies the analysis, but on the other hand makes it impossible to transfer the results to continuous-time systems considered here. Kadmon et al. [3] studied the effect of small noise on the autocorrelation function and showed that noise smooths the transition. However, the fundamental mechanism by which noise affects the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the location of the transition are not understood.\n\nHere, we investigate the effect of additive white noise on the transition to chaos. We develop the corresponding dynamical mean-field theory yielding the self-consistent autocorrelation function. As expected, the autocorrelation function always decays due to the noise and cannot be used as an indicator for chaotic dynamics. A transition to chaos must therefore be qualitatively different from the noiseless case. To find the transition we determine the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which describes the asymptotic growth of infinitesimal perturbations also for stochastic dynamics. We derive an exact condition for the transition from stable to chaotic dynamics. The transition is shifted to significantly larger coupling strengths than predicted by linear stability analysis of the local Jacobian matrix. This hints toward a dynamic mechanism by which noise suppresses chaos in continuous-time systems [4]. ",

In particular, it is assumed that a new stimulus can induce synchronization between different regions of the brain [1,2]. Additionally, it is held that synchronization binds different features of a stimulus and results in a coherent perception [3,4]. However, the underlying mechanisms for robust stimulus-induced synchrony in the nervous system is still unknown. We believe that the proposals of criticality in the brain [5] can help to find the required conditions for the formation of robust stimulus-induced synchrony in neural systems. Accordingly, we have simulated 10,000 integrate and fire neurons with constant weight (w=1.0) and sparsity (0.02) while we changed the proportion of the inhibitory neurons. Simulation results suggest that the maximal stimulus-induced synchrony happens at a specific inhibition to excitation ratio that is highly similar to real-world biological networks. Accordingly, we suggest that the robust stimulus-induced synchrony in neural systems can happen due to a delicate balance between inhibition and excitation. Moreover, our finding can have intriguing implications for theories of criticality in the brain since it suggests that at a specific level of excitation, a property of the system tends to  show a divergent-like behavior. Therefore, we suggest that this property is probably resembling the ‚Äúmagnetic susceptibility‚Äù in previously studied physical systems.\n",

        "text": "Selective and flexible routing among cortical areas is a key prerequisite for efficient information processing. The hypothesis of communication through coherence (CTC) suggests that this routing can be accomplished by means of attention-induced phase shifts between oscillating populations, such that an attended sender is in a favorable phase relation to a receiver, whereas non-attended senders assume a non-favorable phase [1]. Although several network models have been proposed that are capable to realize CTC, it is largely unclear how their relative phases are orchestrated by the attentional state, and it is completely unknown how the corresponding network structures emerge in the first place.\n\nWe use a Wilson-Cowan simplification of a spiking network model of three interacting cortical columns with realistic delays previously shown to reproduce hallmark electrophysiological effects of attention and information routing [2]. In this network, we randomly initialize recurrent coupling weights and introduce noise signals to the two sending populations to probe the efficacy of information transmission according to established experimental procedures [3]. \n\nWe train network weights to optimize specificity of information transmission and find two distinct network structures, both capable of selective routing: an Interneuron-Network-Gamma (ING) network type, where most trained networks show an anti-phase alignment between the two sending populations, and a Pyramidal-Interneuron-Network-Gamma (PING) network type, in which sending populations assume a 2$\\pi$/3 phase relation. Both realizations of CTC do not need an external mechanism which explicitly sets oscillation phases to their desired values: a constant rate modulation induced by attention suffices to self-organize relative phase such that selective information processing becomes possible.\n\nThe distribution of relative phases between the attended/non-attended sending, and the receiving populations makes an explicit prediction for physiological experiments allowing for a critical test of the two CTC realizations.",

        "text": "Memory consolidation, i.e., the transfer of memory from the hippocampus to higher cortical areas, is thought to be mediated by the interplay of specific oscillations. Particularly during slow-wave sleep in rodents, sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) are prominent in local field potential (LFP) recordings of area CA1 in the hippocampus. SPW-Rs are characterized by strong voltage deflections (sharp-waves) with underlying high-frequency oscillations (~150-200 Hz ripples). As accompanied single unit activity reveals a replay of task related neural activity, SPW-Rs are a good candidate to play a key role in memory consolidation. To study underlying cellular processes, we built a  multi-compartmental model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron, which receives postsynaptic ripple currents reconstructed from hippocampal slice recordings. \nWith this model, we could reproduce the experimental finding of sparse spiking activity during SPW-Rs in the pyramidal layer. Sparse firing activity in combination with dense connectivity is known to be instrumental in pattern recognition and reconstruction, which we are interested in as they might be a simple form of memory retrieval and consolidation.\nIndividual SPW-R typically last several cycles. We tested whether spiking is history dependent, i.e., if the amplitude of a preceding cycle influences the spike probability in the current cycle. We did not find such a dependence and concluded that intra ripple cycle history effects are negligible. Thus, we suppose that each cycle could function as an independent computational unit to learn or retrieve different patterns.\nTo further investigate the capacity to store different patterns, we  extended earlier theoretical works [1, 2] with a ripple cycle based, physiologically plausible network model, that reproduces experimental findings while linking those to theoretical considerations on memory capacity.",

        "text": "In the brain, neurons are the basic units that transmit and process information about the external world and internal states. The communication between neurons occurs predominantly in terms of action potentials: information is encoded in a neuron's spiking output. One of the open questions about neuronal communication is how information is encoded in a spike train and how features of presynaptic activity are transformed into postsynaptic spiking output.\n\nIn this work, we investigate the information transmission capacities of mean and variance coded signals. These coding schemes correspond to a signal dependent modulation of mean and variance of the postsynaptic somatic current. Previous work has shown that variance coded signals may transmit fast changing signals more rapidly and with a higher dynamic range (Lindner & Schimansky-Geier, Silberberg et al.). However, the effects of noise in these responses have not been investigated and an analysis of the information transmission capacities is lacking. Here we present an information theoretic investigation of both coding schemes. We find that for stationary input signals variance coding exhibits higher information transmission when the signal spectrum has considerable power at very high frequencies -- suggesting an advantage of variance coding for very fast signals. On the other hand, for a wide range of signal spectra with weight at lower frequencies mean coding possesses a higher mutual information that in some cases exceeds that of variance coding by an order of magnitude.

        "text": "In the last decades, inhibitory neurons have been identified as one of the core elements in shaping the activity of excitatory cells, modulating and expanding the spectrum of dynamical phenomena of neural circuits [1]. In more recent years, the combination of technologically advanced recording methods and the development of transgenic mice lines have boosted the amount of experimental data on various types of GABAergic interneurons [2-6]. However, the individual role of these interneurons are still mostly unresolved. A promising approach to gain insights and investigate the functional role of inhibitory neurons are computational models. \n\nHere, we present the results of a non-linear rate-based network model of layer 2/3 of the rodent cerebral cortex. The microcircuit comprises 4 different cell types: excitatory pyramidal cells (PC) and inhibitory parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons (VIP). All model parameters are constrained by physiological recordings to ensure realistic single cell and network properties [2-6]. We show that the rate response of pyramidal cells in the microcircuit is either shaped by SOM or PV cells. In the steady state, this division of labor is determined by the input regime, in contrast to the responses in the initial phase that are solely dominated by the PV cells. By means of phase plane analyses, we identify neuronal and network parameters that account for the phenomena observed: The cell-specific firing rate curves of the interneurons and the asymmetric connections between SOMs and PVs determine, which cell type dominates the steady-state response. The dominance of the PV interneurons during transient responses arises from their much smaller time constant and the strong connections between PVs and PCs. Furthermore, repetitive stimulation of PC neurons reveals a temporal redistribution from PV-evoked to SOM-evoked inhibition, suggesting a coordinated push-pull effect between PV and SOM neurons.\n\nOur network model makes a number of predictions that can be easily tested in experiments by optogenetically stimulating or blocking various cell types in transgenic mouse lines, and hence may help revealing the functional role of interneurons within microcircuits.",

        "text": "About 2 to 5% of young children experience seizures during high fever, so-called febrile seizures¬†[1]. While changes in pH seem to play a role in the induction of these convulsions¬†[2], our modeling results suggest that the increase in temperature preceding a seizure could also directly contribute to seizure induction. \n\nWe investigated the influence of temperature on type I model neurons and identified a critical temperature range where even mild temperature increases (‚âà1¬∞C) alter single-cell dynamics such that network synchronization increases strongly. This critical temperature range lies close to a codimension-two bifurcation: the saddle-node-loop bifurcation (SNL). At the SNL point, the dynamics of firing onset switch from a saddle-node bifurcation (typical for type I neurons) to a homoclinic orbit bifurcation and, importantly, the phase response curve (PRC) changes from the canonical, symmetric shape to an asymmetric one, strongly favoring synchronization. Such a drastic change in synchronization caused by small increases in temperature constitutes a possible mechanism for the induction of febrile seizures. Our model analysis provides several predictions including the temperature dependence of PRCs and spike shapes, which we test experimentally in recordings of hippocampal pyramidal cells. \n\nWe further analyze whether the proposed mechanism can explain genetic predispositions for strong febrile seizures: prevalence of febrile seizures should increase if a genetic mutation brings a neuron closer to the SNL point. Exploring established models of febrile-seizure-related ion-channel mutations, we find that this is indeed the case. Mutations lower the critical temperature of the SNL point, where synchronization and excitability explode. We conclude that the temperature-induced changes in neuronal dynamics could indeed contribute to the induction of febrile seizures. Because also other parameters can shift neuronal dynamics towards the SNL point, the relevance of the proposed mechanism could extend to other systems marked by a sudden increase in synchronization, such as other forms of epilepsy.

However, the exact relation between the relative occurrence of reciprocally connected pairs and structured connectivity has not been explained.\n\nIn this theoretical work we show that in a network in which connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} = P_{ji}$, the occurrence of bidirectional connections and non-random structures are inherently linked; an overabundance of reciprocal pairs emerges necessarily when the network structure deviates from a random network in any form. For this we consider a random graph model in which each edge has a separate probability $P_{ij}$ to exist and show that when these probabilities are symmetric in pairs, the expectation for bidirectional connections $\\mathbf{E}(P_{ij}^2)$ is minimal for an Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi network [4,5].\n\nFor two distributions of connection probabilities, the discrete two-point distribution and the continuous gamma distribution, we quantify how deviations from an Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi network structure increase reciprocity in the network. Representing different network connectivity principles, such as functionally specific connectivity and distance-dependent connectivity, both the discrete and continuous distribution can easily be tuned to account for a significant overrepresentation of bidirectional connections.",

        "text": "In a population of neurons receiving the same supra-threshold sensory stimulus information transmission can be improved by population heterogeneity as well as noise. This effect, known as ‚Äúsuprathreshold stochastic resonance‚Äú (SSR) [Stocks2000], works by decorrelating the responses in the population. Despite the fact that temporal dynamics play an important role in many systems (e.g. auditory or electrosensory systems) SSR has not been studied for dynamic stimuli yet.  \n\nIn our model system, the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus, two electrosensory systems provide information about different aspects of the electrosensory environment. The receptors of the active system densely encode information such as amplitude modulation of their own field induced by nearby objects or the electric fields of conspecifics up to frequencies of about 300 Hz [Benda2013]. The receptors of the passive system encode electrical fields originating from muscle activity of prey that are in the range below 50 Hz [MacIver2001]. Both systems, though closely related, exhibit different amounts of noise [Grewe2016]. The signals are relayed by the receptor cells to pyramidal cells in the electrical lateral line lobe (ELL) [Maler2009, Krahe2014] which consists of distinct maps that differ in frequency tuning. Also, pyramidal cells in different maps integrate over different numbers of receptors and we suggest that the amount of neurons over which they integrate is optimized with regards to the bandwidth of the two classes of natural stimuli and different noise levels in the input population.\n\nWe simulated populations of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons that were driven by signals with different bandwidth (0-50 Hz, 0-200 Hz). Similar to the static stimuli from Stocks' paper we show for dynamic stimuli that for a fixed neuronal population size there is a certain amount of noise that maximises mutual information between the input signal and the output of the neuronal population; if the amount of noise is kept fixed, we find the optimal population size. For weak stimuli we observe a simple correlation between signal amplitude and optimal noise level.\nWe compare the expectations from the simulations to intrinsic coding properties of pyramidal cells, which were recorded in in vitro recordings from different maps.",

In vitro, it has been shown that trains of action potential can recruit somatostatin expressing interneurons and disynaptic inhibition of neighboring pyramidal neurons in vitro (Silberberg and Markram, 2007; Kapfer et al. 2007). However, in vivo, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons activity is very sparse firing only single or doublet of action potentials (Barth and Poulet, 2012). To examine which circuit could underlie disynaptic inhibition in layer 2/3 in vivo, we made in vivo multiple two-photon targeted whole cell patch clamp recordings in somatosensory cortex of neighbouring layer 2/3 excitatory neurons and identified interneurons in anaesthetized mouse. We found that a single excitatory action potential is sufficient to recruit neighbouring parvalbumin expressing interneurons that subsequently inhibit the local excitatory network. Thus the net impact of a single excitatory action potential is inhibition. Our findings provide a rapid inhibitory feedback circuit that may underlie the sparse firing of cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vivo.\n",

        "text": "Deep neural networks have received considerable attention in the past several years, due to their success in solving real world machine learning applications and their potential importance for understanding sensory processing in cortical sensory hierarchies. However, our theoretical understanding of the computational benefits of deep architectures is  still lacking. In this work we propose a rigorous theory for information processing in feedforward structures.\n\nUsing a simple model of clustered noisy inputs and an analytically tractable learning rule, we derive exact recursion relations describing the propagation of signals and noise along the deep layers. Introducing a performance measure characterising the accuracy of the top readout layer allows us to compare the functionality of different layouts of networks, all performing the same task and using the same learning rules. Interestingly, correlations in the noise structure induced by the synaptic weights affect the dynamics and degrade performances. We find that that deep structures outperform a shallow layout, even when the latter has an arbitrary large size. More generally, for fixed total resources there are optimal depths and widths that maximize the readout performances.",

        "text": "Decision making belongs to one of the most important principles in the nervous system of living species. The crucial trade-off between time to decide (speed) and accuracy is essential for a creature to react to environmental stimuli and most importantly, relevant for survival. In-depth studies of coherent motion tasks in primates, based on two-choice decision experiments, led to a profound understanding of neuronal information processing and even bridged the gap to behavioural psychology. Three fundamental processing stages are needed to successful perform a two-choice decision experiment based on a saccadic eye movement task: the neuronal representation of the sensory signal, the integration of the incoming stimuli and the comparison of the accumulated information to a threshold for a final decision. In accordance to the seminal work of Shadlen and Newsome [1, 2] of decision making in primates, an analogue electronic decision making circuitry was developed. Our concept study includes an LED-display showing moving light dots (i.e. the tasks screen in primate experiments), an array of photo diodes (i.e. retina of the primate, sensory evidence), a Hassenstein-Reichardt Detector (HRD) based motion detection (i.e. a correlation-type motion detector with a high biological relevance, based on an inhibitory circuitry) [3-5] and finally a signal integration circuit. The later stage represents the decision making unit and is realised through an inhibitory mutual coupling of the accumulated signals. The entirely analogue circuitry is based on relaxation oscillators to mimic real neurons. Details of the circuitry and first results will be presented and discussed.",

        "text": "Attentive tracking of multiple moving targets engages widely distributed networks of cortical regions [1], leading to significant functional correlations between time-varying average fMRI signals in these regions.  To study functional correlations at the level of single voxels, we subdivided the recorded volumes in 160990 voxels defined in 90 areas anatomically (AAL parcellation in MNI 152 space, with around 250 to 5k voxels per ROI)[2]. For each voxel, we established the number of significant local correlations (positive or negative) with others voxels in the same area (locFC, [3]) under three behavioral conditions: resting state, passive viewing, and attentive tracking.   Terming ‚Äòstimulus contrast‚Äô (SC) the comparison of passive viewing with resting state and ‚Äòattention contrast‚Äô (AC) the comparison of attentive tracking with passive viewing,  both showed widespread and consistent changes in locFCD: Positive locFCD was decreased in sensory cortices (SC 14k and AC 24k voxels), and increased in Frontal Sup Medial L/R, Frontal Mid L and Cuneus R (SC 400, 200, 100 voxels, respectively), and Occipital Mid L/R and Parietal Sup L/R (AC 450 voxels, 350 voxels, respectively). Negative locFCD was unchanged by SC but increased by AC (inside functional networks VAN and FPC and, to a lesser extent, DAN and LAN) in Frontal Sup L/R, Temporal Mid L/R, Precuneus L/R and Angular L/R (AC 1k, 1k, 850 and 300 voxels respectively).  In summary, we found different changes for positive and negative correlations as well as for areas within and adjacent to frontoparietal networks. We conclude that attentive tracking extensively changes the fine-grained cooperative dynamics of brain activity, as indexed by time-varying MRI signals from individual voxels, confirming and extending traditional studies of coarse-grained cooperative dynamics.",

        "text": "Roving is a random task presentation paradigm, in perceptual learning, whereby multiple tasks are learned in a randomly interleaved sequence. For certain experiments, such as bisection tasks, human subjects appear to be unable to learn the individual tasks under roving conditions (Otto et al. 2006). In general, theoretical descriptions of perceptual learning experiments have resorted to approaches involving tuning of inputs using either recurrence or suppression (Zhaoping et al. 2003, Schaefer et al. 2009, etc.) However, these approaches have exhibited only partial success in  tackling roving. In 2010, Herzog et al. proposed a theoretically inspired explanation involving a constant drift in synaptic efficacies in the system (unsupervised bias), due to an inability to maintain accurate task specific estimates of performance, which leads to a failure to learn using feedback. We present a more realistic update on this model and use it to examine whether the unsupervised bias can still explain roving or not.\n\nThe proof-of-concept model proposed in Herzog et al. does indeed lead to a failure to correctly learn during roving but, while it fails due to the mooted unsupervised bias in the learning rule, the implementation relies on unbounded weight growth, an unrealistic phenomenon. We introduce a simple weight normalisation term, to counteract the unbounded weight growth, and implement a cognitive bias, often observed in human subjects, towards 50:50 presentation ratios, and discover a much more realistic model of human perceptual learning performance. The model (i) learns correctly on a single bisection or vernier task, (ii) fails to learn during roving of multiple tasks, (iii) exhibits the human tendency towards 50:50 ratios of choice, thus failing when a 75:25 ratio is used, (iv) similarly to human subjects (unpublished data), restores correct learning when informed of the altered presentation ratio.\n\nAspects of the model, consistent with intuitions within the perceptual learning community, indicate that the degree of overlap in task representations combined with the unsupervised bias, introduced via relative task difficulty, leads to the difference in outcomes between successful transfer learning versus failure. Interestingly, a cognitive bias towards 50:50 task presentation ratios appears to be quite helpful in a range of presentation paradigms often rescuing potential failures to learn in the long run.",

        "text": "When trying to restore vision in blind patients, a major issue with current approaches based on retinal prosthesis is that the visual acuity of implanted patients remains below the level of legal blindness. Expressing an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells is a promising alternative, but the acuity that can be expected has not been quantified. This acuity cannot easily be measured with behavioral experiments due to the lack of blind primate models.\nHere we combine experiments on mouse and macaque retina, with modeling and ideal observer analysis to estimate the theoretical acuity that could be reached by a patient treated with optogenetic therapy. \nUsing adeno-associated virus, we delivered microbial opsins in mouse and macaque ganglion cells. We measured the receptive fields of these light-sensitive ganglion cells from the explanted retinae and showed that a classical Linear-Non-linear-Poisson (LNP) model predicted well the responses of these cells to complex stimuli.  \nBecause the entire retinal circuit is bypassed by this direct optogenetic stimulation, each cell was conditionally independent of the others. Therefore, from the precisely fitted LNP model, we obtained a complete model of how the population of reactivated ganglion cells responds to complex stimuli. \nWe then performed an ideal observer analysis of this model to estimate how well letters in different orientations could be discriminated by the brain, assuming an optimal use of information. We displayed letters to the model, simulated the ganglion cell responses, and then decoded which orientation was displayed with a Bayesian inversion. The decoding performance gave a prediction of the best acuity that can be reached by patients treated with this type of optogenetic reactivation. The smallest letter size that could be reliably discriminated was 250 microns, corresponding to an acuity of 20/200. This acuity meets the limit of legal blindness, a promising result for future clinical studies.",

        "text": "Fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) in the intraoperative ECoG have recently been shown to be specific predictors of surgical outcome in epilepsy patients. FR detection is restricted by their low signal-to-noise ratio and time consuming visual marking.  We present here a novel approach combining a low-noise recording system with FR automatic detection. \nIntraoperative pre- and post-resection ECoG (N = 9 patients, 5722 minute recordings, 135 channels ) was simultaneously recorded by a commercial device (CD, input noise level 21 nV/‚àöHz) and by a custom-made low-noise amplifier (LNA, input noise level 2.3 nV/‚àöHz). The automatic detector performed first an entropy-based computation of baseline amplitude and then the validation of events in the time-frequency domain. \nThe baseline amplitude for FR was 2.0¬±1.4 ¬µV in CD and 1.3¬±0.8 ¬µV in LNA. FR rates were 0.2¬± 0.5 in CD and 0.9¬±1.5 in LNA (p <0.001).  Across patients, the similarity of spatial patterns between CD and LNA was 0.76¬±0.3 for ripples and 0.2¬±0.4 for FR. Comparing post-resection ECoG FR rates to seizure outcome resulted in PPV = 100% CI [0 100] and NPV = 62% CI [24 91] in CD, and PPV = 100% CI [29 100] and NPV = 80%, CI [35 99] in LNA.  \nOur findings support that low-noise recordings enhance the SNR in the FR spectral range. Furthermore, the combination of an optimized acquisition system with an unsupervised FR detector improved FR detection. This novel tool could contribute to superior epilepsy surgery outcomes in the future.\n",

        "text": "Motor symptoms in Parkinson‚Äôs disease are thought to be associated with pathological synchronization among neurons in the basal ganglia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients, and is hypothesized to desynchronize the neural activity through injecting high frequency current pulses. In the coordinated reset (CR) stimulation of DBS (Tass, 2003), multiple electrodes are used to generate high frequency inputs with different timings to obtain desynchronized state. The CR neuromodulation to the subthalamic nucleus was shown to be effective for improving the motor function of Parkinsonian monkeys. In this study, we construct a neural network model consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, and examine the optimized stimuli for the CR DBS to produce desynchronized network state with less electrical energy. In the proposed DBS method, the stimulus waveform is temporally continuous and described as Fourier series. Each Fourier coefficient is globally optimized by the pattern search algorithm to minimize a weighted sum of the order parameter and current energy. We show that the trade-off problem between the desynchronization effect and energy consumption can be readily addressed by using the proposed method. The simulation results suggest that the DBS with continuous stimuli is more effective to break synchrony than the conventional DBS with pulse-type stimuli. ",

        "text": "Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns (Poirazi et al, 2003, Larkum and Nevian, 2008). In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential (Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016). By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations (Ahmad and Hawkins, 2016). We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models, including echo state networks (Jaeger, 2002) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.

What do glia contribute to information processing that neurons cannot accomplish?‚Äù\nGlia are responsible for creating synapses and managing their activity. Is it only a process dedicated for a single synapse connecting two circuits? If so, then how these processes are created, managed and controlled? There must be a generic meta-composition process for doing so, where the parameters are: two circuits (to be composed), presynaptic neurons of one circuit, and postsynaptic neurons of the second one.\nFrom a theoretical computational point of view, neural circuits can be represented as first order computable functions on natural numbers (spike bursts as natural numbers in the unary code).  Synapse creation between two circuits corresponds to the mathematical notion of function composition. Higher order functions (functionals) are constructed on the basis of the composition. Functionals take functions as arguments, and may return also (other) functions as results. This high order information processing is done by dynamic establishing links (compositions) between functions. Since these very links corresponds to synapse creations, the basic rules for constructing functionals may have counterparts in the human brain as mechanisms for higher order organization of information processing in the neuronal connectome.\nHence, the generic meta-composition process  in the brain may be represented as constructions of higher order functionals. Theoretical research on computable functional in Computer Science is well established, see  [2] and [ 3].\nLet us summarize. Glia are responsible for higher order computations, i.e. for dynamic creating, composing, and reconfiguring neuron circuits. At the bottom level it is realized by creating new synapses; this corresponds to function composition. Since the function composition is the basis for construction of the higher order functions (functionals), the generic processes of dynamic synapse creation correspond to functionals.\nThe hypothesis:   Glia seems to be the appropriate place where the mechanisms, corresponding to the constructions of computable functionals, are realized.\n",

        "text": "Declarative memory denotes the storage of facts and concepts from perceived stimuli. The formation of such memories, in particular their allocation in neural circuits is still an unresolved problem. In general, different stimuli to be learned have to trigger the formation of different memory representations. In addition, each learned stimulus has to maintain its assignment or allocation to its specifically formed memory representation. Experimental findings imply that variations in neural excitability due to a complex cascade of proteins that make individual neurons more susceptible form a memory representation of a new stimulus [1]. Furthermore, the concept of synaptic tagging, which assumes cascades of plasticity-related proteins, is assumed to locally determine the synapses involved in the memorization process [2]. However, both ideas require complex, highly specialized cascades of several proteins to allocate memories.\n\nHere, we show in a theoretical model that the allocation of memory can already be solved by the self-organized dynamics of synaptic plasticity. The system consists of three neuronal populations: an input population projects activity patterns (stimuli) through random excitatory connections on a second, recurrently interconnected memory population. All feed-forward as well as the recurrent synapses are adapted by a combination of Hebbian synaptic plasticity and synaptic scaling [3]. An inhibitory population is mutually connected to the recurrent layer to provide global competition. \nInterestingly, first of all, our model successfully forms stable memory representations: presenting a given stimulus to the recurrent layer causes a locally clustered group of neurons to become strongly interconnected with each other (Hebbian cell assembly [4]). Furthermore, presenting another stimulus of sufficient dissimilarity to the first one causes the formation of another memory representation. Remarkably, if the stimuli are quite similar to each other, both are allocated to the same memory representation. In addition, the system shows the dynamics of competitive memory recall, i.e. differentiating recognition [5], as the activation of one memory representation fully suppresses others.\nIn summary, the here-presented simple but biologically plausible concepts of stimulus-dependent self-organization of plasticity provide a promising approach to the question of how memory allocation is coordinated in the brain.",

        "text": "We recently proposed that episodic memories are best represented by temporal sequences of neural activation patterns and that the hippocampal circuit is optimized to store these sequences [1]. One central feature in this theory, called CRISP, is that hippocampal area CA3 intrinsically produces temporal sequential activities through its abundant recurrent connections. Here, we first study the possible mechanisms by which a relatively fixed recurrent network structure in CA3 can generate neural activity sequences intrinsically. We find that the robustness of sequence generation depends on the network architecture. For instance, randomly connected recurrent networks (RCRNs) are very sensitive to noise, whereas locally connected recurrent networks (LCRNs) generate moderately robust neural sequences [2]. Networks with sparse connectivity, which are trained with sequences of random patterns, exhibit the most robust dynamics. Next we implement a cortico-hippocampal circuit consisting of the EC-CA3-CA1-EC loop. During memory encoding, intrinsic CA3 sequences are hetero-associated with EC sequences, which are driven by sensory inputs. Downstream, CA3 sequences are hetero-associated with sequence in CA1 and finally, the CA1 patterns are hetero-associated with the sensory inputs in EC, thus closing the loop. During memory retrieval, intrinsic CA3 sequences have to be reactivated based on partial, noisy cues, which is provided to EC. Finally, the retrieved sequences in CA3 reactivate the stored sequences in EC via the CA1 layer. We find that memory performance is determined by the network‚Äôs ability to perform pattern completion of individual patterns as well as robust retrieval of sequential information from CA3. These two functions have competing requirements, i.e., the conditions that lead to good performance in one function might have detrimental effects on the other. For instance, modeling CA3 as a LCRN, the stored sequence is retrieved robustly, but the temporal correlations between patterns in the sequence impair pattern completion when decoding the CA3 pattern. On the other hand, a RCRN facilitates decoding, but sequence retrieval fails if any noise is present. Combining the advantages of each of these two models, networks pre-trained on sequences of random patterns achieve a good overall memory performance. In conclusion, we find that the cortico-hippocampal circuit can robustly store and retrieve sequences of pattern, as hypothesized by CRISP.",

        "text": "Grid cells are neurons of the medial Entorhinal cortex that have multiple spatial firing fields arranged in a strikingly-regular hexagonal pattern [1]. Since their discovery, grid cells have been studied extensively, as they are believed to support high-level cognitive tasks, such as self-location, memory, and navigation [2,3]. Nevertheless, to date, the origin of grid-cell activity remains unclear.\nKropff and Treves [4-6] investigated a single-cell model in which grid patterns emerge from a competition between persistent excitation by spatially-selective inputs and the reluctance of a neuron to fire due to spike-rate adaptation. The model provided an important proof-of-principle, but    was formulated at a rather abstract level. In particular, a network-level normalization mechanism effectively coupled the output rates of the neurons such that the simulated patterns did not emerge from a purely single-cell process. Additionally, the synaptic weights did not obey Dale's law, and it was unclear whether the model was robust against shot noise due to stochastic spiking.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we propose here an alternative formulation of the model by Kropff and Treves, which is, on one hand more biologically realistic, and on the other hand better suited for analytic treatment. We show that grid-like patterns can emerge from a purely single-cell process that requires only 1) spatially-tuned feed-forward inputs, 2) spike-rate adaptation, and 3) Hebbian synaptic plasticity. To increase biological plausibility, we constrain the synaptic weights to positive values, and we demonstrate the robustness of the model against shot noise due to stochastic spiking.  Finally, we construct a mathematical theory that quantitatively predicts the results of the numerical simulations, and that establishes a direct link with classical pattern-forming systems via the Turing instability.

In particular, it serves as a classical model for neuroplasticity investigations. Therefore, important plasticity mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression have been identified and demonstrated in the hippocampal field. For the description of the working principles of the hippocampus a circuit model  (see fig.1)  has been proposed which based on auto- and heteroassociative networks. In this talk, a computational neural-network model of the hippocampal circuit is presented. Spiking neurons and memristive Hebbian synapses are employed into Hopfield- and Feedforward network structures. The obtained network performance is discussed in the framework of pattern completion  and recognition and recent studies of mnemonic competence [1; 2].",

        "text": "Numerous experiments have been conducted in the past in order to monitor the complex interactions that drive activity-dependent long-term plasticity of synapses. Spike timing, firing rate and synaptic location have been found to be important factors that dynamically contribute to the outcomes of plasticity induction protocols. While several theoretical models that implement plasticity rules already exist, they have not yet been used in depth to study plasticity in neuron models with detailed morphology. Here, we propose a hybrid biophysical framework based on an existing phenomenological voltage-based plasticity rule and apply it to a L5 pyramidal cell model with active dendritic properties and realistic propagation of voltage. We show that the hybrid rule not only reconciles outcomes of several popular experiments with only slight changes in parameters, but also that it predicts spatiotemporal patterns of plasticity that are characterized by individual stimulation protocols and their impact on local processes at the synapse. Due to this focus on local signals, our framework can explain synaptic plasticity in the absence of postsynaptic action potentials, as suggested in recent studies. We thereby link experimental results that would intuitively seem to require entirely different rules, showing that a unifying rule might explain the vast majority of experiments in cortical pyramidal cells if multiple biophysical pathways are taken into account. Ultimately, we can now study how the cell-type specific electrotonic properties can explain differences in emerging plasticity by incorporating our plasticity rule in a variety of existing detailed compartmental models such as models of hippocampal pyramidal or granule cells. To summarize, a simple plasticity rule that utilizes pre- and postsynaptic plasticity pathways can explain experimental results with a large variety of induction protocols when the plasticity rule is incorporated in the compartmentalized structure of a detailed dendritic model.",

        "text": "Excitatory synapses in cortex typically reside on dendritic spines. Although cortical synapses play an important role in long-term memory, these spines undergo a remarkably high turnover [1,2]. This poses the question how information can be stored on a variable substrate as synapses. As a possible solution, we propose that information is stored and retained by the collective dynamics of multiple synapses. Such a collective dynamics can already be found on the connection between two neurons, which can consist of multiple synapses. More precisely, the experimentally obtained distribution of the number of synapses on these connections, which are bimodal with peaks at zero and multiple synapses, can only emerge from a collective dynamics of the involved synapses [3]. Modelling studies showed that this collective dynamics can emerge from the interaction of synaptic and structural plasticity [4,5] and that altered external stimulations can influence the dynamics such that the neurons become either unconnected or connected with multiple synapses [5].\nHere, we investigate the information storage and retention of these collective dynamics with a simple stochastic model of structural plasticity, where synapses are created with a constant probability and removed with a probability depending on the number of existing synapses and the external stimulation. Using information theoretic measures, we show that the collective dynamics yielding the bimodal distributions of the number of synapses enables information retention on time scales orders of magnitudes longer than the typical lifetime of a synapse. Thus, the conflict of spine turnover and long-term memory can be resolved by storing information in the collective dynamics of multiple synapses.\nYet, at different external stimulation levels where the collective dynamics yield distributions with a single peak either at zero or at multiple synapses, information about the initial conditions decays quickly. This, however, implies that these stimulations can be used to learn new information orders of magnitude faster than it is forgotten. We confirm this by using these stimulations to store an image in a population of multi-synaptic connections. Indeed, this image can be retained orders of magnitude longer than it took to store it. Thus, learning can be faster than forgetting, which is  also a necessary prerequisite to solve the plasticity-stability dilemma in learning and memory on the time scale of structural changes.",

        "text": "Neurons in the adult visual cortex of mice prefer to make synapses with neurons responding to similar visual features. As such a bias in connectivity is not observed at the time of eye opening, it has been proposed that the functional subnetworks are formed through rewiring of recurrent synaptic connections, induced by visual experience [1]. However, it is not clear according to which rules this structure develops. The emergence of feature specific wiring was recently demonstrated in a balanced network model with appropriate rules of functional synaptic plasticity [2]. In this model, however, connectivity was evaluated based on the strength of already existing synapses, and the structure of the network remained unchanged throughout the simulation.\n \nReferring to recent findings of homeostatic regulation of cortical activity in rodent visual cortex in vivo [3,4], we employ here a structural plasticity rule based on firing rate homeostasis described previously [5] for simulating network restructuring during sensory stimulation. We show that, next to other biologically meaningful properties, feature specific connectivity also emerges in a balanced network of changing structure, using a plasticity rule that does not depend on spike timing.",

Here we model cortical circuits that exhibit structural plasticity, using numerical simulations of large-scale recurrent neuronal networks of integrate-and-fire neurons and mathematical analysis. Experimental data suggest that neurons in the neocortex tend to be either unconnected, or they form multiple connections [1]. Also, the distribution of EPSP amplitudes recorded in the primary visual cortex has a long tail, and a small number of very strong connections tends to dominate the network dynamics [2]. The network architecture considered here is a generic neocortical circuit, i.e. a balanced random recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons. We model structural plasticity as a Markov process with transition rates that depend on the strength (size) of synapses [3,4], while the temporal evolution of synaptic strength is described by additive spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that neuronal circuits that exhibit both structural and functional plasticity can help to explain experimentally reported distributions of synaptic weight and number of synaptic contacts in the neocortex. Structural plasticity can indeed explain long tails of distributions of synaptic coupling strength. A subset of strong and persistent synapses could provide a possible substrate for long-term memory.",

        "text": "Persistent activity, the ongoing activation of stimulus-driven neurons in cortical networks, is thought to underlie the cognitive function of working memory and has been observed and correlated with working memory performance in numerous animals studies. A large body of modelling studies has reproduced this kind of activity using cell assemblies with strengthened synaptic connections. However, almost all of these studies have considered persistent activity within networks with homogeneous neurons and synapses, making it difficult to judge the validity of such model results for cortical dynamics. \n\nHere, we consider persistent activity in a highly detailed network model of the prefrontal cortex with heterogeneous distributions of neuron and synapse parameters which are determined by anatomical and in vitro electrophysiological data, and which has previously been shown to statistically reproduce a wide range of measures from in vivo prefrontal data [1]. We found that persistent activity was prevented by the naturally occurring heterogeneity in the neuron parameters of the inhibitory interneurons and the parameters of short-term synaptic plasticity, while heterogeneity e.g. in the synaptic weights or the parameters of the pyramidal cells has no such effect. In particular, cellular heterogeneity makes a subset of the interneurons overly excitable, which results in a strongly skewed distribution of interneuron firing rates which cannot be compensated by adjusting its mean. We also show that persistent activity is recovered if the effective excitabilities of the interneurons are aligned to each other by regulating their background input, e.g. by means of a homeostatic plasticity mechanism. Furthermore, the synapses connecting the assembly neurons must be selected such that they exhibit only a single type of short-term synaptic plasticity (facilitating or depressing) for each pair of cell types. Cell assemblies shaped by these two principles may be potentially targeted by distinct inputs or become more responsive to specific tuning or spectral properties. \n",

        "text": "Humans are able to perform cognitive strategies to solve problems they are faced with. Thus, they generate a huge variety of strategies which cannot all be hard wired in their neuronal networks which consist of a finite number of neurons. One hypothesis is that neural entities are reorganized to participate in different cognitive purposes. Therefore, different entities are exploited, recycled, and redeployed and, thus, put to different uses without losing their original function [1]. Given this idea, to enable an accurate reaction according to a given situation, humans adaptively organize the learned memories of previous experienced environmental stimuli. However, the neuronal principles for the functional reorganization of the brain, thus, for rewiring the links between memories are still unknown.\nHere, we use an adaptive neuronal network model depending on the interactions of synaptic plasticity [2, 3] and synaptic scaling [4]. Hebbian synaptic plasticity adapts the efficacies of synapses dependent on the corresponding neuronal activities [5]. With the intertwined mechanism of synaptic scaling, thereby, synaptic plasticity yields the formation of strongly interconnected subgroups of neurons (cell assemblies; CAs) [6]. These CAs serve as neuronal representations or memories of specific environmental stimuli [5]. As we are interested in the functional organization of the brain, we started to investigate the interaction between two memories. We describe the dynamics for the representation of each memory by homogeneous populations and drive the CAs with different external stimuli. It is shown that neuronal competition (synaptic plasticity combined with synaptic scaling) is mandatory for the formation of CAs [4, 7]. Here, we investigate the role of competition between memories for their functional rewiring. Therefore, we combine synaptic plasticity with different generic synaptic scaling mechanisms. Thus, we gradually increase the influence of synaptic scaling from a constant to a more complex and activity-dependent condition. Interestingly, increased competition between both CAs leads to the formation of different functional interactions between them. Dependent on the external drive and the internal competition the two-memory system is capable to build up different functional links between these memories such as association, discrimination, and sequence [8].\nThis work describes different forms of functional organization of memories in the brain.",

        "text": "Oscillatory patterns such as sharp wave-ripple complexes (SWR) are important for memory consolidation [1]. SWRs are oscillations of the extracellular field potential that can be decomposed into a $\\approx100$ ms long sharp wave superimposed by $\\approx200$ Hz fast ripple oscillations. The hippocampal neuronal network that is responsible for the ripple generation is currently not well understood [2-4]. \nA promising model for the generation of ripple oscillations is based on recurrent interneuronal networks of fast parvalbumin-positive basket cells in the hippocampal region CA1 [4]. According to this model, the interneuron network in CA1 receives a burst of excitation from CA3, the sharp wave, which leads to an ultrafast synchronization of the collective activity that causes the ripple oscillations. In these networks, interneurons are not exclusively connected by chemical synapses but are also coupled by gap junctions. While the functional role of the chemical synapses for the SWR oscillations has been studied extensively (e.g. [5]), the role of electrical synapses has attracted less attention [6].\nHere, we investigate the contribution of gap junctions to the ripple component of the SWR by employing numerical network simulations. The network is realized by leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, which are recurrently connected by inhibitory chemical synapses and gap junctions. The gap junctions are implemented in the LIF network following an approach from Lewis and Rinzel (2003). The effects of the different gap junction parameters such as coupling strength and connectivity on ripple oscillations are explored. We show that gap junctions increase the oscillation synchrony and robustness, while the network frequency is only mildly affected. A comparison of these findings to experiments that investigate the role of gap junctions is in particular interesting since these recordings, which either rely on gap junctions blockers or Cx36-knockout mice, show contradicting results.

        "text": "Grid cells in the enthorinal cortex fire in a triangular pattern that tessellate the surface of the surroundings, assumed to form a spatial map of the environment. If grid cells are to be used as a spatial reference, they need to be stable by somehow anchoring to their environment. Although strikingly regular, the grid pattern does not consist of homogenous equidistant triangles but display local distortions in the shape and the orientations of the vertices, related to the walls and corners of the recording enclosure. The consistencies of the distortions over animals suggest that they arise from a common mechanism, possibly reflecting the anchoring of the grid to the environment. \nThere are several conceptual models describing how the grid pattern is formed and shifted during locomotion of the animal. In the continuous attractor model the specific connectivity between grid cells form an activity bump that is moved using input from speed and head direction cells, which are also found in the entorhinal cortex. The adaptation model, however, assumes that the grid is learnt anew in each novel environment, relying on place cell input from the hippocampus that together with synaptic plasticity and spike rate adaptation forms a grid. \nOur main focus regards the development and distortions of the grid pattern during learning. In a novel environment the continuous attractor and the adaptation models should behave differently. Therefore, in this study we look at how grid cells respond to a novel environment with a focus on spatially localized distortions and the dynamical unfolding of the grid pattern. We examined grid cell activity during the first few moments when an animal first experienced a new enclosure in an unfamiliar room and recorded several sessions after that to study the long term development of the pattern. \nWe found that grid cells display rich dynamics during learning a new environment possibly reflecting how the entorhinal cortex uses sensory cues such as corners and walls of the environment for anchoring. Our hope is that the data will provide evidence for how the grid is formed and more generally how computations within and between different areas of the cortex are executed. ",

        "text": "Mediotemporal EEG characteristics are closely related to long-term memory formation. It has been reported that rhinal and hippocampal EEG measures reflecting the stability of phases across trials are better suited to distinguish subsequently remembered from forgotten trials than event-related potentials or amplitude-based measures (Fell et al. 2008, Lopour et al. 2013). Moreover, we recently have described that single-trial rhinal and hippocampal phase values per se are predictive for subsequent memory (H√∂hne et al. 2016). For the majority of subjects (23 out of 27) above chance prediction (overall accuracy 69.2%) was possible based on only three absolute single-trial phase values. Prediction based on absolute single-trial phase values outperformed that based on power values. However, it remained an open question whether relative phase values (i.e. the phase differences relative to a previous time point) are as well suited for memory prediction as absolute phases. This would mean that phase adjustments triggered by the to be memorized stimuli are predictive for subsequent memory. Therefore, we analyzed EEG signals from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex of 27 presurgical epilepsy patients with implanted depth electrodes. Intracranial EEG was recorded while patients performed a continuous word recognition task. Phase information relative to stimulus onset was used for prediction of subsequently remembered versus forgotten trials applying a support vector machine for two-class classification. Above chance prediction was possible for the majority of patients (19 out of 27) using just one rhinal phase value, one hippocampal phase value and one rhinal-hippocampal phase difference from the post stimulus interval (overall accuracy 64.9 %). In contrast to absolute phase values, no significant difference can be found between prediction accuracy based on relative phase values compared to that based on power values. Prediction accuracies based on absolute single-trial phase values surpassed those based on relative single-trial phase values. These findings indicate that the absolute EEG phases within rhinal cortex and hippocampus and not the relative phases are most relevant for successful memory encoding.",

        "text": "The strengths of excitatory synapses in cortex and hippocampus have been shown to follow a rightward-skewed or long-tailed distribution [1,2]. Such distributions can be achieved in recurrent balanced networks [3,4], after synaptic modification by Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) [5] and synaptic scaling [6]. Recently, long-tailed distributions have also been observed for inhibitory synapses in cultured cortical neurons [7], confirming early findings in hippocampal slices [8]. However, the conditions and plasticity mechanisms necessary for achieving long-tailed distributions of inhibitory synapses are unknown. Furthermore, different forms of inhibitory STDP have been reported, but the effect of various inhibitory learning rules on the distribution of inhibitory synaptic efficacies have not been explored [9-11].\n\nHere we demonstrate that plasticity in the inhibitory synapses in a self-organised recurrent neural network (SORN [12]) with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons can lead to long-tailed distributions of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic weights under different types of iSTDP. The dynamics of the inhibitory weights over time resemble the experimental data on inhibitory synaptic strengths [7] given a precise ratio of potentiation and depression in various iSTDP window types.\nWe additionally find that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory currents is improved when the distribution of inhibitory weights is right-skewed. \n\nOur results suggest that long-tailed distributions of inhibitory weights are likely to be a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits that employ different plasticity mechanisms.\n",

        "text": "Basal ganglia circuits are involved in motor control including the initiation and cancellation of movements. While movement-related firing rate changes of single neurons have been described in different basal ganglia subregions and cell types, the resulting population coding schemes remain unclear. Different population coding schemes may reflect different functional contributions of each subregion and cell type to motor control. Here we apply advanced data analysis techniques to a large data set of electrophysiological recordings in rats performing a stop-signal task to study those schemes. We use dimensionality reduction techniques to generate low-dimensional trajectories that characterize the diverse firing patterns during movement initiation.\n\nStarting from conventional principal component analysis, we use information theory to describe the population coding schemes, geometrical measures to interpret the low-dimensional population trajectories, and matrix theory to better understand the mathematical structure of the underlying trajectory space. We find that different subregions and cell types have distinct population trajectory shapes during movement initiation. For example, the trajectory for the substantia nigra (pars reticulata) shows an almost linear evolution around movement, while the trajectory for the subthalamic nucleus has a more complex shape. Furthermore, we find that the trajectories for all the subregions differ from those expected from smoothed random processes. In addition to the time-based analysis, we develop further measures to describe the structure of the  population code based on sparseness and heterogeneity. While sparseness is a measure of the amount of active neurons during a particular condition, heterogeneity describes the diversity in the response patterns. We find that the coding scheme in striatal medium spiny neurons is sparse and heterogeneous. In contrast, the code in the substantia nigra pars reticulata is distributed and homogeneous. This points to the input and output stages of the basal ganglia having opposite coding strategies. These differences can have direct clinical implications because the effect of deep brain stimulation is also likely to depend on how heterogeneous and sparse the code in the target region is. ",

        "text": "Neurons in the hippocampus involved in spatial navigation like place cells are known to respond more variable to the place stimulus than expected for poissonian response activity [Fenton and Muller 1998, Fenton et al. 2010]. This phenomenon is called over-dispersion and lead to several conclusions ranging from attentional fluctuations, dynamic tuning and others [Fenton et al. 2010]. Here we show that also grid-cells in the entorhinal cortex show over-dispersion in grid fields.\nFurthermore we suggest an alternative mechanism producing the high variability of grid cells, i.e. that subgroups of the grid population rest or burst together and thus lead to noise correlations as reported by Mathis et al. 2013. To test our hypothesis we extensively simulate grid cell firing activity using a contineous-zero-inflation model and compare it to electrophysiological data. Our findings constrain the hippocampal formations ability to decode the animal‚Äôs current location and we provide tools to improve statistical modelling of grid cell spike trains.",

        "text": "In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data (cf. Haynes, 2015), 'second-level' inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a $t$-test vs chance level across subjects (e.g. Haxby et al., 2001). We argue that while the random-effects analysis implemented by the $t$-test does provide population inference if applied to activation differences (Holmes and Friston, 1998), it fails to do so in the case of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures (Kriegeskorte et al., 2006), because the true value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint changes the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which becomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that there are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that it generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis. This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We review possible alternative approaches to population inference for information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population (Friston et al., 1999; Rosenblatt et al., 2014).",

        "text": "A central question in sensory neuroscience is to understand how sensory information is represented in neural activity. A crucial step towards the solution of this problem is the characterization of the neuron‚Äôs receptive field (RF), which provides a quantitative description of those features of a rich sensory stimulus that modulate the firing rate of the neuron.\nFor visual neurons, the stimulus space can be very high dimensional, and RFs have to be estimated from neurophysiological recordings of limited size. The scarcity of data makes it paramount to have statistical methods which incorporate prior knowledge into the estimation process (Park & Pillow 2011), as well as to provide quantitative estimates of uncertainty about the inferred RFs (Stevenson et al 2011). For many sensory areas, there are canonical parametric models of RF shapes ‚Äì e.g., Gabor functions for RFs in primary visual cortex (V1) (Jones & Palmer 1987). Bayesian methods provide a quantitative way of evaluating these models on empirical data by estimating the uncertainty of the inferred model parameters.\nWe present a technique for full Bayesian inference of the parameters of parametric RF models, focusing on Gabor-shapes for V1. We model the spike generation process by means of a generalized linear model (GLM, Paninski 2004), whose linear filter (i.e., RF) is parameterized as a time-modulated Gabor-function. Use of this model dramatically reduces the number of parameters required to describe the RF, and allows us to directly estimate the posterior distribution over interpretable model parameters (e.g. location, orientation, etc.). The resulting model is non-linear in the parameters. We present an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure for inferring the full posterior distribution over model parameters.\nWe show that the method successfully detects the presence or absence of a RF in simulated data ‚Äì even when the total number of spikes is very low ‚Äì and can correctly recover ground-truth parameters. When applied to electrophysiological recordings, it returns estimates of model parameters which are consistent across different subsets of the data. Our current implementation is focused on the response of simple cells in V1, but the approach can readily be extended to other sensory areas or non-linear models of complex cells.",

        "text": "The quantity and complexity of experimental data being recorded in Neuroscience is increasing quickly. Many traditional data analysis tools do not scale to large datasets and there is an urgent need for accessible high-performance algorithms. To this end we developed and released a flexible Blind Source Separation (BSS) method that is capable of handling high-dimensional data such as 2p imaging recordings and encompasses many traditional methods such as sparse Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. More concretely, the algorithm is (1) based on a high-throughput probabilistic formulation, (2) can flexibly incorporate prior information about the sources (e.g. sparsity or non-negativity), (3) employs random-projection PCA to reduce its memory-footprint and can (4) be run on the GPU.\n\nWe apply the method to a 2p imaging video recorded in a zebrafish, extract regions of interest (such as the position of cells or dendrites) and single-cell calcium traces and then compare with manual labeling. We additionally benchmark the algorithm quantitatively on a composition of a 2p recordings with manually appended cells. On large-scale data the new algorithm can easily be 1-2 orders of magnitude more memory- and run-time efficient then other commonly employed BSS algorithms and can often discover more meaningful sources due to its flexible incorporation of prior information (like the sparse, non-negative responses of single cells with localized ROIs).",

However, both assumptions about the source of stochastic processes contributing to this variability and the parametric form vary across the literature (Macke et al, 2011; Yu et al, 2009; Lin et al, 2015). These differences have critical impact on response statistics and therefore affect the predictive power of population methods. Here we formulate two models which represent different assumptions on the source of spiking variability. The Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model reproduces the linear relationship between the mean and variance of spike count responses using a Poisson process to generate spikes. Beyond the variability in spike generation, we model a second source of variability, that is correlated among neurons, as a multivariate distribution for membrane potentials. In contrast to the DSP model, the Rectified Gaussian (RG) model (Carandini, 2004) assigns variability solely to membrane potentials and assumes a spike generation process with minimal amount of stochasticity. We confirm that single-cell statistics of the two models are compatible and therefore can achieve similar predictive performance on the marginals of population responses. Critically, we derive contradicting predictions on changes in response correlations when membrane potential means and variances are manipulated, which can potentially dissect the predictions of DSP and RG models. In order to contrast the predictions of the two models, we build a population model of V1 neurons and test stimulus-contrast and orientation-related changes in noise correlations. Using single unit spike trains recorded from the V1 of awake monkeys (Ecker et al, 2010), we show that the difference of the population distribution of spike counts at different stimulus contrast levels in the experimental recordings is compatible with the predictions of the RG model but contradict those of the DSP. Distributions of spike counts in response to stimuli with different orientations are compatible with both models, but also favor the RG against the DSP. We conclude that based on co-activation statistics of spiking responses, it is possible to discriminate between spiking models assuming different sources of variability without explicit knowledge of the membrane potential statistics, allowing for the efficient prediction of response correlations.

        "text": "\nAs one gains more intuitions and results on the importance of concerted activity in spike trains, models are developed to extract potential canonical principles underlying spike coding. These methods shed a new light on spike train dynamics. However, they require time and expertise to be implemented efficiently, making them hard to use in a daily basis by neuroscientists or modelers. \n\nTo bridge this gap, we developed the license free multiplatform software ENAS integrating tools for spike trains analysis and simulation. These tools are accessible through a friendly Graphical User Interface that avoids any scripting or writing code from user. Most of them have been implemented to run in parallel to reduce the time and memory consumption. One of the main strength of ENAS when compared to competing software is to provide statistical analysis with Maximum Entropy-Gibbs distributions taking into account both spatial and temporal correlations as constraints, allowing to introduce causality and memory in statistics. Conversely, given this analysis or other known statistics, ENAS one can also generate new spike trains.  These methods result from a series of work (e.g. Vasquez et al. 2012, Nasser et al. 2013, Nasser and Cessac 2014) and they have already been applied to the analysis of retina data in Vasquez et al 2014 and Herzog 2015. This comes in addition to basic visualizations and classical analysis for statistics of spike trains analysis. All these tools are generic and can be applied to any spike train.  \n\nInterestingly, ENAS also includes specific tools dedicated for vision, and the retina in particular. For example, one can jointly visualize stimulus and spiking activity or estimate receptive fields. ENAS also includes a virtual retina simulator extending former simulator (Wohrer and kornprobst 2009) to include lateral connections in the IPL. \n\nWe hope that ENAS will become a useful tool for neuroscientists to analyze spike trains and we hope to improve it thanks to user feedback.  Our goal is to progressively enrich ENAS with the latest research results, in order to facilitate transfer of new methods to the community. It is downloadable from https://enas.inria.fr where documentation, tutorials and samples of spike trains are available.\n",

        "text": "The tendency of neurons to fire bursts of action potentials has been associated with many physiological processes, including information processing and long-term potentiation. Precise identification of periods of bursting activity thus plays a critical role in many applications, such as the accurate quantification of time course changes in network behaviour during development, or as a result of pharmacological or genetic manipulations. Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings of cultured neuronal networks are a common and efficient means of studying this bursting activity in vitro. \n\nTo address the problem of accurate identification of bursts, a large number of burst detection techniques have been proposed, many of which have been developed and verified based on MEA recordings from rodent nervous systems. Recently, human stem cell-derived neuronal networks cultured on MEAs have been shown to exhibit spontaneous bursting activity [1]. There is thus a demand for a robust method of analysing bursting in these networks, which commonly exhibit more variable and complex patterns of bursting activity than rodent neuronal networks [2]. \n\nUsing both synthetic and experimental data, we assessed the performance of a number of existing burst detection techniques at identifying bursts in spike trains with properties resembling those of human neuronal network recordings. We identify a number of issues with common burst detection techniques, and show that although no current method can provide ‚Äòperfect‚Äô burst detection results, two burst detection techniques, the MaxInterval [3] and logISI [4] methods, outperform compared to others. We further use these methods to examine the ontogeny of bursting activity in networks of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons over several months of development. \n",

        "text": "Structured spiking activity of neural populations is believed to convey information of sensory signals perceived by an animal. Therefore, to understand the fundamental principles of perception and cognition it is crucial to study the statistical structure of population activity. However, variability and dynamics of recorded data make this a nontrivial task. Approaches inferring dynamic networks conventionally assume stationarity over repetitions of a behavioral paradigm or reduce the dimensionality of the data. Here, we propose a different approach that does not postulate any stationarity and still infers a full coupling structure of a population.\n\nWe consider a spike train model that generates spike data $S=\\{\\boldsymbol{s}_1,\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{s}_T\\}$ according to a certain state. This state may switch occasionally and hence the statistics of the data change. In detail: At each time $t$ a network's activity with $N$ neurons is described by an  $N$-dimensional binary vector $\\boldsymbol{s}_t$. We assume that at each time point the network is in a certain state $z_t=k$. If this is the case the probability of the activity pattern $\\boldsymbol{s}_t$ depends on the coupling matrix $J_k$ and the previous activity $\\boldsymbol{s}_{t-1}$. The transition probability is known as the 'kinetic Ising model'. The couplings $J$ may switch at each time point with probability $\\gamma$. When the state changes, the next state $l$ is chosen with state probability $\\pi_l$. For a fully Bayesian approach the model assumes priors over all latent parameters $J,\\boldsymbol{\\pi},Z$. Thus, the full model describes a Dirichlet process with an additional state switching dynamics. The graphical model is shown in Figure $1$. \n\nExact inference of model parameters is intractable. For approximate inference the state labels $Z$ are considered to be independent from the rest of the parameters resulting in a variational approach. \n\nWe show that inference can be done accurately for artificial data, i.e. couplings $J$, state labels $Z$ and state probabilities $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ are inferred correctly. Furthermore, V4 spiking data recorded while a monkey performed a simple fixation task [$1$] are analyzed. The model identifies distinct states in ongoing and evoked activity.  \n\nThe framework allows single-trial analysis of neural data while still considering the full connectivity matrix of a network. It may particularly be useful when activity changes rapidly due to stimuli or internal states.",

        "text": "Stereo vision in biological systems is based on disparity-tuned cortical neurons integrating visual information from the left and the right eye. Disparity tuned neurons also show specificities for other stimulus parameters, most notably edge orientation and scale. They are therefore often modeled as a pair of Gabor functions, one for the left and one for the right eye, with the differences between these two functions defining stereo disparity. As a consequence of neuron-based disparity representation, biological stereo systems do not react exclusively to position-defined point disparities, but also to intensity differences between the two half-images of a stereogram [4,5,6]. Indeed, human stereo vision is not adequately described by calculating a list of feature-disparities from solutions of the correspondence problem; rather intensity-based disparities and higher order shape descriptors have been shown to play an important role [2,5]. \nWhat are the primitives of stereo vision? As one possible access to this problem, we study the joint statistics of stereoscopic image pairs, using a neural network approach, the sparse coding algorithm. It has originally been proposed to be the underlying mechanism of neural receptive field generation and is therefore largely inspired by response properties of cortical neurons and by reasoning about the goal of sensory coding [3,4]. \nWe extend the sparse coding algorithm described in [7] to binocular images and present and analyze the resulting disparity-tuned receptive fields. The results show that disparity tuning occurs in unsupervised learning of sparse image codes without explicit cues to object depth or disparity. Binocular kernels show both, phase-based and position-based disparities but no strong dependence between the two types. The co-existence of both disparity types is in line with neurophysiological findings [1,8] but in conflict to older claims that phase disparity should be preferable. Furthermore the results indicate that the arising binocular receptive fields are not restricted to point disparity detectors, but include detectors for intensity-based and higher order disparities. In ongoing work, we will expand on the catalog of stereo disparities and test putative disparity types in psychophysical experiments on human depth perception.\n",

        "text": "The present study focuses on the inference of network parameters from empirically observed activity. This problem has attracted a lot of interest in the past decades. The detection and strength estimation accuracy depends on the model assumed for the node dynamics. In particular, graphical models (for partial correlations), autoregressive models and linear-nonlinear models have been successfully applied to large networks. Here we consider various models of noise-diffusion networks, including the first two models mentioned above, and provide a mathematical analysis that links them. \nWe apply the corresponding methods to estimate either the presence of a connection or its strength. Following our recent study [1], we focus on fMRI data for which we estimate the so-called effective connectivity, namely the strengths of dynamical interactions between cortical areas. We discuss the improvement of the method when combining anatomical information obtained using diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), which constrains the cortical model by providing a skeleton and reduces the number of connections to tune. For noise-diffusion models, these methods provide quantitative estimates of both inputs and connectivity, which allows for the study of the propagation of activity in the cortical model.",

        "text": "In recent studies spike train recordings from large populations of neurons have been analyzed by estimating the information transfer in these networks using transfer entropy[1]. This quantifies the directed interactions between neurons as a model-free method even for non-linear interactions. High information transfer between two spike trains is evidential for an underlying excitatory synapse between the neurons, but even inhibitory synapses show significant information transfer when observing sufficient spiking activity. We extend the effective connectivity analysis by revealing whether the information transfer is coming from an excitatory or an inhibitory synapse. To distinguish these type of interactions we analyze the local transfer entropies[2] of each interaction and define the sorted local transfer entropy as the discriminating quantity. We improve these network reconstructions by applying state-conditioning[3] to the entropy estimations to remove the network effects during highly synchronized events, which leads to a better delay estimation of the interactions. Surrogate tests, where the presynaptic spike times are jittered, but the inter-spike interval distributions remain largely unchanged, also improve the reconstruction. We also explore various normalization techniques of the entropies and show their effect on the reconstructions. Assuming Dale's principle, we further show that neurons can be correctly classified into excitatory and inhibitory from their estimated outgoing connection types. \nWe test these techniques on simulated spike trains from random networks of Izhikevich neurons with random synaptic delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity evolved connection weights like in a previous study, showing that we can distinguish interaction types, improve the reconstruction and classify the neurons.\n",

        "text": "In empirical research it is vital to ensure that inferences are caused by the intended experimental manipulations and not by confounding influences. A well-established approach to avoid and control for confounds is to employ classical design principles pioneered by Fisher, such as counterbalancing the presentation order, and to carry out additional analyses on control data. Here we investigated whether this standard practice is suitable for neuroimaging studies using cross-validation or multivariate decoding.\nWe find that this standard practice can ‚Äì counterintuitively ‚Äì lead to the exact opposite of what it should achieve: Classical design principles might not only fail to effectively control confounds, but can even induce them. This can lead to systematic positive or negative statistical biases (such as significant below-chance decoding accuracies), potentially yielding false positive or false negative findings. As a consequence, researchers who believe they successfully controlled confounds may be tempted to conclude with stronger certainty that their results are correct, even though this conclusion is not justified. Interestingly, these problems typically do not depend on whether multivariate or univariate analyses techniques are used; neither are they specific to decoding approaches or multivariate pattern analysis. Instead, they are caused by \"design‚Äìanalysis interactions\", i.e. designs that are not suitable for the employed analysis pipeline.\nWe provide several examples illustrating the effect of incompatible designs and analysis pipelines and demonstrate how intuitions about effects of classical design principles can be misleading. In order to effectively detect, avoid, and eliminate these and related problems, we suggest to perform the same analysis that is used to analyse the main experimental data on (i) design variables, (ii) control data, or (iii) simulated data. The approach can be employed either after data collection to detect problems and quickly test potential remedies; or it can be applied before data is collected, thereby preventing errors already at the design creation stage. Although we demonstrate these effects for neuroimaging experiments, the same analysis approach can also detect, avoid, and eliminate similar problems in other fields that employ complex analysis pipelines, such as machine learning or genetics.",

        "text": "Many sensory systems have been shown to exploit sparsity in order to efficiently encode natural stimuli [1]. Here we address the question whether sparse coding of head motion yields efficient representations and whether there is physiological evidence for this coding principle. We learned a sparse code from recordings of linear acceleration and angular velocity of human head motion. The code consists of a set of signal-adapted basis functions, or kernels, that represent temporal patterns of all six degrees of freedom of movement. We found that these kernels  can efficiently encode  the majority of  naturally occurring movements. However, highly sparse representations do not permit exact stimulus reconstruction, in part due to the inherently non-linear relationship between angular velocity and acceleration due to gravity. Furthermore, we found evidence that the learned code employs a distributed encoding of rotational and translational components, similar to neurons in the vestibular nucleus (VN), the first stage of vestibular convergence [2]. \n\nWe recorded linear acceleration and angular velocity of head motion from 10 different subjects performing 7 different activities each (running, biking, walking on grass, walking on pavement, playing soccer, walking upstairs, walking downstairs) using an inertial measurement unit, the MTx from Xsens. This data was used to learn a sparse code which could efficiently encode natural head motion using a multivariate dictionary learning algorithm [3]. The coding performance was evaluated by encoding a distinct set of test data with the learned kernels and measuring the error of reconstruction from the coded data. \n\nWe also measured the energy contained in the rotational and translational components of the kernels, respectively. This energy corresponds to their sensitivity to either types of motion. We found a distribution different from that found in the training data with some kernels mostly responding to linear acceleration, others to angular velocity and a majority of kernels sensitive to both. This encoding is similar to that observed in VN neurons, supporting the hypothesis that the convergence in the VN is optimized to permit efficient coding of head motion at higher stages of vestibular processing.",

        "text": "Recent advances in multi-unit recordings pave the way for a quantitative understanding of the statistical structure present in the responses of large neural populations. An intriguing feature of the correlations observed in both real [1] and artificial [2,3] neural populations is criticality‚Äîa term coined for the observation that the dynamic range of the frequencies of observed population patterns is anomalously large. Here we introduce a general method for constructing probabilistic models which take into account the prior knowledge that the modeled population could be close to critical. The class of models we consider consists of an energy function which parametrizes interactions between small groups of neurons, and an arbitrary positive, strictly decreasing, and twice differentiable function which maps the energy of a population pattern to its probability. Both the parameters of the energy function, and the nonlinear map from energies to probabilities have to be learned from data. Our models admit an interpretation in terms of a latent variable globally coupling the whole population which is a recently proposed mechanism underlying criticality [4]. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we show that augmenting an energy function which models pairwise interactions between neurons with a nonlinearity yields an accurate description of the activity of retinal ganglion cells. Criticality has also been observed in many other datasets such as natural scenes or amino acid sequences of proteins suggesting that our method has a wide range of possible applications.",

        "text": "Managing neuroscience data requires the integration of information from multiple sources. Information about stimuli, animals, protocols, and other background information about the experiment, together often called \"metadata\", are necessary to interpret the resulting data correctly. Storing such information consistently alongside the recoded data is therefore an essential part of experimental research and depends crucially on available file formats. Many existing formats provide only limited support for storing metadata along with the data. Here we present the NIX project, consisting of an open format and software tools to store, organize, and link data and metadata. The format[1] can represent various kinds of recorded and derived data in conjunction with all the metadata and links between data entities to facilitate data organization and data retrieval, as well as data sharing. Units and dimension information is stored directly with the data, for immediate correct interpretation. The NIX software libraries support direct, fine-grained access to the data and the linked metadata. This enables selecting specific subsets of the data, such as signals recorded from a certain electrode channel, or spike trains from a certain single unit in trials with a given stimulus. Efficient use of NIX format features is facilitated by software libraries for different languages, including C++, Python [2], Matlab [3], and Java [4]. Installable packages exist for different platforms, together with documentation, examples, and tutorials [5]. The NixView program [6] can be used to explore, plot and export the stored data in a user-friendly and convenient way. The NIX project includes tools that link to other open data format projects like Neo [7,8] and Neuroshare [9]. This enables seamless integration of data access with data analysis, and creates a route for the conversion of raw data from various proprietary formats to the open NIX format. Moreover, results of data analysis done with Neo, e.g. using the Elephant [10] toolkit, can be saved in the very same format. The NIX project thus supports comprehensive annotation and efficient organization of neuroscience data, and the variety of libraries makes it easy to integrate access to data and metadata in the lab data collection and analysis workflow.",

        "text": "Deep convolutional neural nets (DCNNs) are the most successful computational models of primate ventral visual pathway for object recognition. Interestingly, DCNNs tolerate object variations as humans do[1], use IT-like object representations[2], and match the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ventral pathway[3]. Nevertheless, DCNNs are not biologically plausible in terms of neural processing (sending floating-point values) and learning mechanism (supervised backprop algorithm). Actual neurons communicate with each other by sending spikes, and the information is coded in the spike times. Besides, learning in primates is mostly unsupervised, and at the neuronal level, depends on spike times (e.g. STDP). Employing such neural coding and learning mechanism in DCNNs would decrease the power consumption, and resolve learning deficiencies like overfitting and the need for millions of labeled images.\nSeveral spiking deep neural network (SDNN) have been proposed in recent years[4,5,6], but none of them exploit temporal coding and unsupervised spike-based learning at the same time. Here, we propose to encode the information in the timing of first spikes and employs STDP to learn visual features, like [7] and [8], but using a deeper architecture.\nFigure A illustrates a sample architecture of the proposed SDNN. The first layer uses DoG filters to detect contrasts. It codes the strength of these contrasts in the latencies of its output spikes (the higher the contrast, the shorter the latency). Neurons in convolutional layers detect more complex features by integrating input spikes from the previous layer which detects simpler features. Convolutional neurons emit a spike as soon as they detect their desired visual feature determined by their input synaptic weights. Neurons that fire earlier perform STDP and prevent others from doing so via a one-winner-take-all mechanism. In this way, more salient and frequent features will be learned by the network. Pooling layers provide translation invariance and also compact the visual data using a local maximum operation. Receptive field sizes gradually increase through the network and neurons in higher layers become selective to complex objects or object parts (See Figure B), in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, a supervised SVM classifies  the input images based on the extracted features.\nWe evaluated our proposed SDNN on MNIST, Caltech face/motorbike, and ETH-80 datasets and reached accuracies of 98%, 98%, 81%, respectively.",

Nidus is being developed as a collaboration between the Neuroscience SimLab at the Forschungszentrum Juelich and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) under the aegis of the NEST Initiative.  The trend towards \"many-core\" architectures such as GPU and Intel Xeon Phi based systems demands new approaches in software development and algorithm design.  Nidus is being written specifically for these architectures; it aims to be a flexible platform for neural network simulation, interoperable with the models and workflows of NEST and NEURON.\n\nImprovements in performance and flexibility will enable a variety of novel experiments, but the design isn't finalised, and will be driven by the requirements of the community.  This is where you come in!  We are very interested in your ideas for features which will make new science possible: we ask you to think outside of the box and build this next generation neurosimulator together with us.\n\nPossible features and use cases:\n\n o Simulate significantly larger networks over longer time scales\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Larger proportion of CNS systems with morphological detail\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Longer simulations for slowly developing phenomenon\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Improved statistical power by leveraging large data sets\n\no A well defined high performance C++ API which allows tight integration with other codes\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Multiscale by coupling with simulations at other scales\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Real-time visualization on HPC resources\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Online statistics to avoid scaling bottlenecks\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Networks embedded in physically modeled animals\n\n o Dynamic data structures which allow the creation of models with a time-varying number of neurons, synapses and compartments\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Neuronal development\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Healing after injury\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†- Age related neuronal degeneration.\n\nWhat questions haven't you asked yet?",

        "text": "Neuronal spike trains often show changes in their firing activity such as changes in the intensity or regularity of spike occurrences. Violating such changes may yield misleading statistical analyses if they require stationarity of the underlying models. Therefore, we are interested in locating ‚Äôchange points‚Äô in spike trains, i.e., points in time where the intensity or regularity of spike occurrences change. With regard to statistical modeling, one can then segment the spike train into regimes that can be assumed approximately stationary.\nWe propose a multi-filter procedure that aims at the detection of change points that appear on different time scales within the same train. For that, we test the null hypothesis of absence of change points. After rejection of the null, we use a multi-filter algorithm in order to localize change points. This is a two step procedure where we first analyze changes in the intensity. Second, we investigate changes in the regularity incorporating the information about the estimated intensity. Our approach is applicable to spike trains modeled by a large class point processes including Poisson- or renewal processes (i.i.d. ISIs), as well as processes with even less restrictive ISIs (renewal processes with varying variance).\n",

        "text": "Dynamic changes in the firing rates of neuronal discharges can be important signals for information processing as well as problematic for statistical analyses that are sensitive to rate changes. Therefore, we propose a multiple filter test (MFT) that tests the null hypothesis of rate stationarity and an algorithm that estimates the change points in the rate. Most importantly, our method incorporates practically relevant issues: (1) un unknown number of rate changes can occur (2) on multiple time scales, (3) other process parameters such as the variance of inter spike intervals are unknown, and (4) processes can show a high variety of patterns and distributions, including also serial dependencies.\n\nOur MFT uses a filtered derivative process with multiple filters that converges weakly to a parameter free limit process that can be used to obtain the rejection threshold for the test. By specifically estimating serial dependencies in the test statistic, we show that the MFT can be applied to a variety of empirical firing patterns, including positive and negative serial correlations as well as tonic and bursty firing. We apply the newly proposed method to an empirical data set of spike trains with serial correlations and use simulations to show improved performance against methods that assume independence. For positive correlations, our new MFT is necessary to reduce the number of false positives, which can be highly enhanced when falsely assuming independence. For the frequent case of negative correlations, the new MFT shows an improved detection probability of change points and thus, a higher potential of signal extraction from noisy spike trains. ",

        "text": "Retinal Ganglion Cells spiking activity changes with the stimulus, generating different spatio-temporal patterns, depending on the stimuli features. One-way to analyse these patterns and their link to the  stimulus is the use of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models generalised so as to take into account the network history, memory and causality [1,2]. The price to pay, however is a huge set of parameters that must be fitted to experimental data to explain the observed spiking patterns statistics. There is no a priori knowledge of which parameters are relevant and which ones are contributing to overfitting. We propose a method of dimension reduction, i.e. a projection on a relevant subset of parameters, relying on the so-called Susceptibility matrix (œá) closely related to the Fisher information. In contrast to standard methods in information geometry though, this matrix handle space AND time correlations. The spectral analysis of œá, allows, as we show, to extract the relevant/irrelevant dimensions. Especially, we observe several cut-off in its spectrum, for synthetic and experimental data. These cut-offs can be interpreted in the context of information geometry in terms of effective volume in the space of parameters [3]. \n\nWe have applied this method for retina data obtained in a diurnal rodent (Octodon Degus) and a 252-MEA system. Three types of stimuli were used: spatial and temporal uniform light (photopic spontaneous activity, PSA), white noise (WN) and a natural movie (NM).  The results will be presented in the poster.  Especially we shall show the role played by time-delayed pairwise interactions in the neural response to stimuli both for close cells (with overlapping receptive fields) and distant cells (where correlations are not due to overlap of receptive fields). Our conclusion is that, to explain the population spiking statistics we need both short-distance interactions as well as long-distance interactions, meaning that the relevant functional correlations are mediated not only by common input (i.e. receptive field overlap) but also by long range connections.",

In particular, acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) trigger long lasting plastic changes in the response properties of sensory neurons. These modifications may serve to adapt sensory representations to the requirements of perceptual tasks, thereby improving perception. Here, we investigate this hypothesis in a neural network model. We model the release properties of ACh and DA as well as their putative effect on synaptic plasticity. We then measure the impact of the neuromodulators on the performance of the network on a visual classification task. In the model, ACh release follows task difficulty, a proxy for attentional demand. DA release follows reward prediction errors. Both neuromodulators act identically on synaptic plasticity by modulating the sign and magnitude of the network‚Äôs learning rate. We find that these two signals trigger distinct changes in sensory representations but both yield improvements in classification performance. ACh leads to population-wide reorganisations such that more neurons encode stimuli that are challenging for the network. DA adapts synaptic weights such that neural responses better match the distinct classes of the task at hand. These results indicate that neuromodulatory signals affecting synaptic plasticity can refine sensory representations and improve perception.",

        "text": "Visual contrast sensitivity has an optimal spatial frequency while lower or higher spatial frequencies are progressively harder to detect. The equivalent internal noise paradigm[1] decomposes contrast sensitivity into two independent quantities: Equivalent Internal Noise and Computational Efficiency. The decline of sensitivity towards high spatial frequencies is likely to be due to optical and acuity factors. The decline at low spatial frequencies comes mostly from an increase in internal noise[2]. This effect is even more pronounced in aging[3], accounting for most of the sensitivity decrease at low spatial frequencies in older observers. To explain this dependency on both spatial frequency and age, we consider three hypotheses: \n(a) An increase in variability, which would lead to a measurable increase in equivalent internal noise. However, it is unlikely that cortical processing of low and high spatial frequency stimuli relies on vastly dissimilar mechanisms, such that their internal variability could actually be different.\n(b) Different sizes of cortical receptive fields, according to which the increase of equivalent internal noise would stem from the larger integration area over which the stimulus, and thus the external noise, is averaged, thus reducing the ratio of external over internal noise. Cortical cells do in fact have larger receptive fields for low spatial frequency stimuli[4].\n (c) A change in non-linearity, such as the cortical contrast gain control. Retinal, thalamic and cortical gain control mechanisms affect contrast thresholds and internal noise. Baldwin et al.'s model[5] explains the sensitivity decrease by the saturation variable of the gain control non-linearity. Yet, they cannot explain why the gain control depends on spatial frequency, other than receptive field area. \nWe tested these hypotheses in a linear-non-linear orientation detection model. We could recreate an increase in internal noise when using appropriate increases in spatial integration at each spatial frequency (hypothesis b). Mechanisms (a) and (c) could also be used to alter equivalent noise measurements (possibly explaining aging effects at low spatial frequency). In this poster, we discuss the plausibility of spatial frequency and age dependence for each of the proposed mechanisms, as well as interactions between them.",

        "text": "During natural viewing, image flow on the retina is determined primarily by the behavior of the observer. Eye movements during active visual exploration, such as saccades, are particularly dominating in this regard, especially because they incessantly occur 3-5 times per second. Despite this, retinal image processing has in the past often been studied with isolated stimuli, ignoring the highly dynamic aspects of natural viewing. We are therefore exploring the effects of eye-movement induced image motion on signal processing in the retina. \n\nWe recorded activity of ganglion cells from isolated mouse and pig retina using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) while showing a visual stimulus paradigm mimicking saccades. The paradigm consisted of rapid saccade-like image shifts across the retina followed by a test stimulus at different intervals after the saccade.\n\nWe found that the retinal responses to these \"test stimuli\", when presented in the context of saccades, are strongly modulated in comparison to responses to the same stimuli presented in isolation. Moreover, we show that saccades exude their modulatory effects for up to 1 second, suggesting a highly relevant role of eye-movement induced effects under natural conditions with short inter-saccadic fixations. Importantly, our results indicate that saccade-related retinal modulation critically depends on the statistical properties of the background scene present during the saccade; on the ambient luminance level; and on the specific retinal cell type. For example, the responses of OFF ganglion cells, but not ON ganglion cells, can be positively modulated after saccades. This suggests that the different pathways within the retina are distinct with respect to the properties of saccadic modulation. Thus, the diversity of modulations known from higher visual areas might be, at least in part, caused by the diverse modulations seen in the retina.\n",

        "text": "Moving gaze from one point of a scene to another is coupled with a mandatory shift of attention: visual performance increases selectively at the saccade target (Kowler & Schneider, 1995 [1]; Deubel & Schneider, 1996 [2]). The mechanisms underlying these pre-saccadic attention shifts remain unclear. Here, we investigate if saccade preparation modulates perceptual orientation tuning curves, similar to attention-related changes in neuronal orientation tuning in visual cortex. In a psychophysical experiment, we presented two sequences of randomly oriented Gabor patches at a temporal frequency of 30 Hz, left and right of fixation. Simultaneously with the onset of these two sequences, a central cue pointed to one of them, and observers were asked to generate a rapid eye movement to the cued location. The sequences disappeared with saccade onset. Upon saccade landing, a response cue highlighted with equal probability the location of the saccade target (congruent trials), or the opposite location (incongruent trials). Observers had to report whether a target orientation (horizontal or vertical, defined before each block of trials) was present in the sequence. Using a reverse correlation approach, we studied distributions of stimulus orientations in trials in which observers reported presence of the target orientation, allowing us to quantify the temporal dynamics of perceptual orientation tuning before saccade onset. We observed a strong influence of saccade preparation on perceptual orientation tuning: Present reports were associated with orientations tuned to the target orientation if these appeared within 100ms before saccade onset, and this effect was specific to congruent trials. Our findings suggest that pre-saccadic perceptual benefits arise from the temporal dynamics of orientation tuning before saccades. We will discuss similarities and differences in the dynamics of perceptual and neural orientation tuning curves.\n",

        "text": "The detection of motion direction and velocity in visual scenes is important in everyday tasks, e.g., for avoiding cars when crossing the street or for assessing the optic flow when navigating through a room. We study the encoding of visual motion on the level of the retinal ganglion cells. There, direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) are known to encode certain directions of a drifting pattern. They are thought to provide important information about the optic flow to higher brain areas. In the salamander, we found three subtypes of DSGCs whose preferred directions are separated by 120¬∞, similar to the directional organization of ON-type DSGCs observed in mouse. We probed the motion encoding of salamander DSGCs with more complex motion patterns than simple drifting gratings and projected textures following a 2-dimensional random walk onto the isolated salamander retina. We recorded up to 30 DSGCs simultaneously with multielectrode arrays for performing population analysis.\nWe used a commonly deployed linear decoder to estimate which features of a random motion trajectory a downstream neuron could extract from the responses of individual DSGCs and DSGC populations. The linear reconstruction of the motion trajectory from individual DSGC responses captured low-frequency components of motion into the cell's preferred direction. We derived the mutual information between stimulus and linear reconstruction and found that the joint activity of DSGC populations with different preferred directions conveyed more information than the sum of its individual contributions. This synergy is caused by the fact that motion encoding by individual DSGCs for complex stimuli is strongly confounded by non-motion-direction-related activity, leading to a non-monotonic nonlinearity in the motion encoding. The concerted firing of DSGCs with different preferred directions can counteract the ambiguity of this non-monotonic stimulus dependence.\nOur findings suggest that in complex visual scenes, the decoding of motion direction from DSGC responses is challenged by the simultaneous encoding of strong contrast changes in the cell's receptive field caused by large translational movements of the pattern in either direction. This leads to a strongly nonlinear direction encoding whose unfavorable effects for linear motion decoding are partly compensated by the concerted signalling of DSGCs with different preferred directions, causing synergy.",

        "text": "When free-viewing scenes, the first few fixations of human observers are driven in part by bottom-up attention. Over the last decade a large number of models have been proposed to explain these fixations. One problem the field is facing is that the different metrics used to evaluate model performance produce very different rankings for the models. We recently standardized model comparison using an information-theoretic framework and found that existing models captured at most 1/3 of the explainable mutual information between image content and the fixation locations, which might be partially due to the limited data available [1]. Subsequently, we tried to tackle this limitation using a transfer learning strategy. Our model \"DeepGaze I\" uses a neural network (AlexNet, [2]) that was originally trained for object detection on the ImageNet dataset. It achieved a large improvement over the previous state of the art, explaining 56% of the explainable information [3] (Figure 1c). In the meantime, a new generation of object recognition models have since been developed, substantially outperforming AlexNet. The success of ‚ÄúDeepGaze I‚Äù and similar models suggests that features that yield good object detection performance can be exploited for better saliency prediction, and that object detection and fixation prediction performances are correlated. Here we test this hypothesis. Our new model \"DeepGaze II\" uses the VGG network [4] to convert an image into a high dimensional representation, which is then fed through a second, smaller network to yield a density prediction. The second network is pre-trained using maximum-likelihood on the SALICON dataset and fine-tuned on the MIT1003 dataset. Remarkably, DeepGaze II explains 83% of the explainable information on held out data (Figure 1c), and has since achieved top performance on the MIT Saliency Benchmark. The problem of predicting spatial fixation densities under free-viewing conditions could be solved very soon.\nWhat makes DeepGaze predictions different? Models before DeepGaze were not only close in performance but also very similar in their predictions, clustering mostly around a simple mean-contrast-luminance model (MLC, Figure 1d). Prediction performance over time shows that DeepGaze II is especially successful at explaining fixations in the first 600ms (Figure 1e). The fact that fixation prediction performance is closely tied to object detection informs theories of attentional selection in scene viewing.",

        "text": "Neurons in the central nucleus of the main center of convergence in the auditory midbrain, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) have been shown to display either linear significant receptive fields [1] or both linear and nonlinear significant receptive fields [2]. In this study, we used reverse correlation to probe linear and nonlinear response properties of single neurons in the cat ICC. The receptive fields display areas of stimulus parameters leading to enhanced or inhibited spiking activity, and allow investigating neural processing of complex sounds. Spiking responses were obtained from recordings of anesthetized cats in response to dynamic moving ripple (DMR) stimuli [3]. The DMR sound contains amplitude and frequency modulations and allows systematically mapping neural preferences. Spike-triggered average and covariance were computed for the envelope of the DMR, separately for each frequency carrier (range of 0-5.5 octaves). This enables studying processing of the sound envelope, and to investigate whether nonlinearities are more pronounced at the neuron's preferred frequency rather than for other frequencies. We find that more than half of the neurons display significant nonlinear response properties at least for one frequency carrier. Nonlinearities are dominant at the neuron's best frequency. The nonlinear preferences have either the same or opposite temporal receptive field pattern (e.g. on-off) as the linear preferences. No relationship to other neural properties such as feature-selectivity, phase-locking, or the like has been found. Thus, these nonlinearities do not seem to be linked to a specific type of neuron but to be inherent to ICC neurons indicating a diverse range of filtering characteristics.",

        "text": "An objective of sensory neuroscience is to understand how the brain responds to the natural world.  This is true for the sense of hearing, however much of our understanding of the auditory system has been garnered using carefully crafted artificial stimuli.  In this study we employed natural sound textures, such as sparrows chirping or a stream flowing, to investigate the functional organization of the human auditory system using fMRI and sound synthesis.  Behavioral evidence from McDermott and Simoncelli (2011) suggest sounds textures are identified using time-averaged summary statistics, but possible neural mechanism have yet to be explored. In this study, synthetic textures were generated from ‚Äútexture statistics‚Äù, including marginal moments and pair-wise correlations, measured from a model that captures the frequency and amplitude modulation selectivity of the auditory system. Contrasting the BOLD-signal change between synthetic textures and spectrally matched noise for six different texture families, we observed texture-selective responses in auditory cortex, including Heschl‚Äôs Gyrus and anterior planum temporale. In a second experiment, we generated textures by cumulatively including five subgroups of statistics for seven different texture sounds. A corresponding increase in BOLD-signal strength in auditory cortex was observed as the statistical subgroups were included. However, the BOLD-signal strength in inferior colliculus was similar for all statistical subgroups.  In a corresponding behavioral experiment, we found that listeners‚Äô ability to identify textures generated with different statistical subgroups correlated with the parametric increase in BOLD-signal strength, particularly in right planum polare and left planum temporale. Collectively, these results point towards a cortical mechanism that could identify auditory textures via time-averaged statistics.",

        "text": "Human sensitivity to the temporal detail of statistically homogenous sounds such as rain, fire, or flowing water (otherwise known as ‚Äúauditory textures‚Äù) decreases with the stimulus duration. After the first few hundred milliseconds following stimulus onset, the auditory system seems to form a lossy, compressed representation of the detailed structure of texture sounds, as reflected by the inability to distinguish different exemplars of the same texture. This observation might be considered surprising given the known ability of auditory neurons to precisely encode fine temporal properties of sound, and it remains unclear why certain sounds have such a coarse perceptual representation. It has been proposed that lossy stimulus transformations are a consequence of inability of sensory systems to encode stimuli exceeding certain informational bandwidth. \n\nWe consider whether sensory compression might instead be consistent with a normative perspective. We assume that the goal of the auditory system is to maximize information about the environment while minimizing energy expenditure. To achieve this goal the system should decrease encoding accuracy (i.e. coding cost) of stimuli which carry little information about the state of the world. Stimuli originating from a distribution which is predictable and known to the observer would accordingly be compressed in a lossy way. Due to their temporal stationarity, auditory textures are a prime candidate for such compression scheme.\n\nTo distinguish normative compression from capacity limits, we dissociated waveform coding cost (entropy, i.e. ‚Äúdensity‚Äù) from stationarity by introducing practical measures of these properties. This allowed us to quantify them in natural sounds. In a psychophysical study we found that sound source stationarity, rather than entropy rate, was predictive of human performance in an exemplar discrimination task. Listeners had difficulty discriminating different exemplars generated by a homogenous source regardless of their entropy, suggesting that compression is not primarily due to coding capacity limits. In a second experiment we found that human listeners became able to discriminate the temporal detail of high entropy sounds following changes in the generating distribution. Taken together, our results suggest that perceptual compression of auditory textures reflects an adaptive coding strategy that minimizes processing resource when representing uninformative stimuli.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Recent studies have pointed out that the neural code may use multiplexing to encode unique information at different temporal scales of spike trains [1,2]. However, how to mathematically separate out the different components of a neural code and to identify the unique contribution of each time scale to sensory coding and behaviour has remained an open challenge.\nHere we investigated this problem by analytically deriving the information loss caused by adding to the spike times a random jitter uniformly distributed within a given time range whose size is varied parametrically. By increasing the size of the jitter range we destroy gradually and in a controlled manner the contribution of the different temporal scales, from fine to coarse. Therefore, the derivative of the information with respect to the jitter represents the non-redundant information that each temporal scale conveys about the stimulus, and provides a way to easily quantify and summarize in one single figure the encoding strategy used by each individual neuron to temporally encode a particular set of stimuli. \nTo implement this approach, which we termed the Information Derivative (IDE) method, we approximated the information derivative with respect to the jitter as follows: 1) we analytically derive the average firing rates associated with an arbitrary jitter size; 2) we use these analytical firing rates to compute the information contained in the jittered neural response, assuming no noise correlations. We tested the IDE method with simulated data in which several temporal scales are relevant for discriminating the presented stimuli and confirm the method is able to detect the contributing temporal scales and to assign the correct relative contribution to them.\nThe IDE method we propose allows inferring the contribution of different temporal scales to the information contained in the neural responses about a given set of stimuli. The method thus provides a way of studying in detail the information processing capabilities of a multiplexed neural code.\n",

        "text": "The mouse gains ever increasing importance as a model to study the visual system. One well established behavioral methodology to quantify visual abilities in mice is based on the optomotor reflex: Mice compensate for global image drift in the visual environment with reflexive eye (optokinetic) and head (optomotor) movements. This behavior can be used to characterize the visual features that can still be recognized by the animal, thus gaining information about spatial acuity or contrast sensitivity. \nIn the ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù optomotor drum, the animal is surrounded by computer screens which display a slowly rotating striped cylinder. Previous versions of the optomotor drum suffered from three major shortcomings, which are addressed in our newly developed \"OptoDrum\" testing system. First, there was no animal detection software available to provide reliable position data to analyze the gaze direction. We developed a robust automated image analysis package, for detecting freely moving mice in a non-static illuminated background. Our algorithm is specifically adapted for the precise detection of head-follow movements, to analyze the behavior inside the optomotor drum. Second, with freely moving animals, accurately measuring the visual acuity is compromised when the distance between the subject (mouse) and the object (rotating stripes) changes. We solve this problem by automatically adjusting the stripe width in real time to the position of the animal. Third, assessing the animals' behavior has previously been performed by human observers, introducing subjectiveness and bias to the results. We have developed a robust algorithm which scores the animals' behavior reliably without user interference. \nOur data show the applicability of the method by characterizing the contrast sensitivity function of wild type (wt) mice, as well as the progressive decline of visual performance in mouse models of retinal degeneration. \n",

        "text": "Our experience of the world depends on integration of cues from multiple senses to form unified percepts. How the brain merges information across sensory modalities has been the object of debate. To measure how rats bring together information across sensory modalities, we devised an orientation categorization task that combines vision and touch. Rats encounter an object comprised of alternating black and white raised bars that looks and feels like a grating and can be explored by vision (V), touch (T), or both (VT). The grating is rotated to assume one orientation on each trial, spanning a range of 180 degrees. Rats learn to lick one spout for orientations of 0¬±45 degrees (``horizontal'') and the opposite spout for orientations of 90¬±45¬∞ (``vertical''). Though training was in VT condition, rats could recognize the object and apply the rules of the task on first exposure to V and to T conditions. This suggests that the multimodal percept corresponds to that of the single modalities. Quantifying their performance, we found that rats have good orientation acuity using their whiskers and snout (T condition)Õæ however under our default conditions, typically performance is superior by vision (V condition). Illumination could be adjusted to render V and T performance equivalent. Independently of whether V and T performance is made equivalent, performance is always highest in the VT condition, indicating multisensory enhancement. Is the enhancement optimal with respect to the best linear combination? To answer this, we computed the performance expected by optimal integration in the framework of Bayesian decision theory and found that most rats combine visual and tactile information better than predicted by the standard ideal observer model.  Electrophysiological recordings in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of behaving rats revealed that neuronal activity is modulated by decision of the rats as well as by categorical or graded modality-shared representations of the stimulus orientation. Because the population of PPC neurons expresses activity ranging from strongly stimulus related (e.g. graded in relation to stimulus orientation) to strongly choice related (e.g. modulated by stimulus category but not by orientation within a category) we suggest that this region is involved in the percept-to-choice transformation.",

        "text": "To understand how sensory input maps to neural activity is one of the key goals of sensory neuroscience. Ever since the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel [1] the notion of receptive fields have greatly aided our understanding of how information entering our senses is represented in the brain. Though receptive fields were initially posed as a property of individual neurons, it is now clear that the notion of receptive fields can also be applied to a population of neurons in for example an fMRI voxel [2]. Current techniques for estimating population receptive fields have been using a grid search approach to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood. Here we present a Bayesian technique that poses several advantages over the currently used approaches. \nOur technique is based on estimating the posterior probability of the receptive field parameters given  measured neural data by use of a slice sampler. By estimating a probability distribution we automatically obtain an uncertainty measure of the estimated parameter values in contrast to the grid search approach, where just the best fit is returned. In estimating the posterior we have the benefit of being able to include priors on our parameters, which can greatly improve the estimates of the population receptive field estimates. \nWe show in simulations that our technique improves the estimate of population receptive field parameters over the grid search approach. On a real fMRI data set, we compare our approach to the grid search approach and show the benefits of having an uncertainty measure and a prior on the population receptive field parameters.\nThe flexibility of this Bayesian approach also provides possibilities for easy extensions of this model. Here we use only Gaussians as the underlying population receptive field model, but this approach can easily be extended to estimate more complex models of receptive fields. Furthermore, it is possible to extend our model to also include estimates of physiological parameters of a voxel such as its hemodynamic response function. We believe that the flexibility and benefits of our approach will make it a valuable tool for any researcher trying to understand the mapping from sensory input to neural activity.",

        "text": "Physico-chemical processes in all living creatures strongly depend on temperature. In nervous systems, this particularly applies to the ion channel kinetics underlying electrical activity [1]. Therefore, variations in temperature are likely to interfere with signal encoding and information processing. Mammals invest energy into the maintenance of a constant body temperature, thus retaining functional nervous systems despite a temperature dependence of their components. In contrast, cold-blooded animals (poikilotherms) adopt the temperature of their surroundings, such that changes in temperature directly affect neural processing, with potentially severe consequences for behavior. Yet, many poikilotherms exhibit robust behaviors across the temperature range they are exposed to, and hence must have developed compensatory mechanisms.\n\nFemale grasshoppers, in particular, recognize the courtship song of male conspecifics across a temperature range of around 15¬∞C [2]. Whether this robustness is achieved at the cellular or network level is unknown. Here, we address this question and, first, studied the effect of temperature on ascending neurons, a known bottleneck of sound processing [3]. To that end, we fitted linear-nonlinear models [4,5] to neural responses to sound stimulation at different temperatures. We found no consistent effect on nonlinear processing, but temperature affected the shape of neural temporal filters, ruling out a purely cellular mechanism of temperature compensation.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the recorded cells apparently did not match the known temperature robustness of song recognition on the behavioral level. We hence tested how to resolve this discrepancy using a neural filter-based model of song recognition. Relying on a very basic set of computations, our model quantitatively reproduced published grasshopper song preferences [2]. Importantly, introducing the measured temperature dependence of neural filters to the model enabled temperature robustness of song recognition.\n\nOur results hence suggest that temperature robustness of song recognition is achieved via a network effect, based on temperature-dependent neural filters. Due to its simplicity, the proposed mechanism of temperature compensation may be used in other poikilothermic sensory systems.",

        "text": "The extraction of visual features into parallel streams begins in the retina. Visual stimuli are transmitted from the photoreceptors via the bipolar cells to the retinal ganglion cells, which in turn relay the signal to the brain. In mice, processing streams diverge from 3 types of photoreceptors to 14 types of bipolar cells types to at least 32 ganglion cell types (Euler et al., Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2014; Baden, Berens, Franke et al., Nature, 2016). Two-photon imaging with calcium and glutamate-sensitive fluorescent indicators allows us to record neural activity in the mouse retina. In many cases of interest, multiple functional units are present within a single recording field, corresponding to axon terminal systems or dendritic trees of different bipolar or ganglion cells or ‚Äì in the extreme - to different axon terminals or dendritic compartments of the same cell.\n\nHere, we present experimental and computational methods for the reliable identification and separation of such components. Specifically, we establish alternative imaging strategies which improve the spatiotemporal resolution of the data allowing us to better separate signals from different neuronal compartments. In addition, we designed light stimuli to probe for differential activation of functional units. Finally, we developed computational models to capture the dynamic correlational structure in the data. Our preliminary data from bipolar cell axon terminals suggests that noise stimuli and simple receptive field estimation techniques can be used to identify functional units belonging to single cells. Units likely corresponding to axon terminals of a single bipolar cell often show distinct spatiotemporal patterns of activity, suggesting that different axon terminals of a single cell can signal partially independent information.\n",

        "text": "Rodents are becoming increasingly popular models for the integrative study of the neural circuits underlying vision (Zoccolan et al., 2015). To lay solid foundations for such investigations, it is crucial to reconstruct the receptive field (RF) spatiotemporal structure of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1), which is the first stage in the cortical processing chain of visual information. Reverse correlation approaches, such as Spike Triggered Average (STA), allow probing visual neurons with random spatiotemporal luminance patterns to infer the RF transfer function (or filter) underlying the unit‚Äôs stimulus-response relationship (Schwartz et al., 2006). These methods have been successfully applied for this purpose in monkeys (Ringach et al., 2002), cats (DeAngelis et al., 1993) and, more recently, mice (Niell and Stryker, 2008), but never in rats.\nIn our study, we performed extracellular neuronal recordings, via 32-channel linear microprobes, from anesthetized rats, passively exposed to full-field, full-contrast visual stimulation. We recorded from 67 single units in V1. Their tuning profiles were assessed by analyzing their responses to drifting gratings, designed to match a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. We found the majority (~70%) of our sample population to be orientation selective (OSI >= 0.6) (Fig.1a, left panel). A much lower share (~30%) exhibited direction selectivity (DSI >= 0.6) (Fig.1a, central panel). The preferred combination of spatial and temporal frequency was observed to be 0.02 cpd and 4 Hz, respectively (Fig. 1a, right panel). Two examples of such tuning profiles are reported in the figure (Fig. 1b, left and central panels).\nSTA analysis, performed over the pattern of neuronal responses elicited by 0.02 cpd-matched Gaussian noise movies, allowed uncovering striking features in the RF structure of the sample population: i) multiple-lobed, Gabor-like structures (see examples in Fig. 1b right panels); ii) spatiotemporal inseparability, with inversions of excitatory and inhibitory lobes over the time preceding a spike. These properties were predictive of single unit orientation and direction tuning, as assessed with gratings. These results speak to the complexity of the computations performed by rat V1 neurons, highlighting their similarity with those performed by highly-visual mammals (such as monkeys and cats), thus stressing the potential of rats as models to investigate fundamental aspects of cortical visual processing.",

        "text": "Fast gamma oscillations are commonplace along the visual pathway and can provide an effective mechanism to amplify and route information towards higher order visual areas and/or a way to bind simple visual features into a unique, more complex, percept. In the mouse these oscillations have been studied mainly in primary visual cortex and in relation to locomotor activity [1,2]. Less is known about how these oscillations are modulated by diffuse illumination (irradiance) in freely behaving animals and whether this modulation, if present, plays any functional role in visual perception. \nIn a previous work we showed that different levels of photopic irradiance have a strong widespread effect on dLGN baseline and evoked firing rates [3]. Here we describe the emergence of gamma oscillations, a complementary component of irradiance spike responses in dLGN.  \nWe first show that gamma oscillations are reliably triggered by 10s irradiance steps both in anaesthetized mice and in awake freely moving mice (Fig.1A). In awake animals these oscillations are present both in stationary and moving animals. \nWe carry on showing that these oscillations are coherent throughout the whole extent of the dLGN.  Increasing irradiance increases coherence in the gamma band (Fig.1B). Narrowband coherence has an important functional role: it allows an effective summation of responses throughout the dLGN. If disrupted the summed population response is substantially reduced (Fig.1C).  \nFinally we show that long latency oscillatory potentials in mouse flash ERG also express narrowband gamma oscillations. By performing simultaneous ERG-dLGN recordings we confirm that they these oscillations are inherited from the inner retina. \nOur data show that irradiance driven gamma oscillations robustly occur during unconstrained behaviour, are inherited from the retina and, by enhancing coherence, provide a suitable temporal structure for population coding. \n",

        "text": "Pitch is a fundamental attribute of auditory sensation. A dyad is a sound presenting two simultaneous pitches; it is one of the most common perceptual scenarios in human auditory soundscape. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of dyads are poorly understood.\nDyads evoke a strong percept related to the ratio between the fundamental frequencies of the two sounds. Simple ratios (e.g. 3:2) evoke a consonant, pleasant sensation while complex (e.g 16:15) ratios evoke a more dissonant percept. The N100m is a transient neuromagnetic response of the auditory evoked fields observed in MEG recordings, sensitive to fundamental auditory properties such as pitch or timbre [4]. The N100m is associated with activity in the antero-lateral Heschl's gyrus (alHG) in human auditory cortex (AC) [3]. \nFirst, we studied the effect of consonance and dissonance on the dynamics of the N100m using six different dyads built from two iterated rippled noise (IRN). We found a strong and significant correlation between the dissonance percept reported by human listeners (Fig. A, grey) and the latency of the N100m (Fig. A, blue).\nThe major goal of this study was to understand this correlation on the basis of the competitive dynamics of a cortical excitatory and inhibitory network of neural ensembles[6], endowing realistic neural and synaptic parameters [2]. Excitatory populations encode the pitch value, and receive direct inputs from an idealised model of subcortical processing [1], based on a well established model of the auditory periphery [7]. In accordance with recent findings on the organisation of the mammal AC [5], inhibitory-to-excitatory connectivities follow a harmonic pattern that is crucial for cortical processing of pitch.\nThe model was able to simultaneously decode the two single pitch values present within the stimuli, and to predict the latencies of the N100m evoked by the dyads (Fig. A, red; Fig. B compares field predictions and observations). \nThe model output suggests that the correlation of the N100m latency with consonance perception stems from the harmonic connectivity structure in AC. Simple frequency ratios (consonant dyads) preserve a greater harmonic relationship than more complex ratios (see green dashed lines in Fig. A), and thus are naturally faster to decode in cortex, eliciting an earlier N100m.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the simulated competition dynamics in alHG provide a mechanistic explanation of consonance perception.

        "text": "Assessing, validating and improving quality of human-robot interaction (HRI) is so far commonly performed by collecting subjective measure from human interaction partners in experimental HRI setups, e.g. questionnaire ratings. Although these measures can be of high value to roboticists and designers when aiming to improve general HRI, they are very sensitive and can be inaccurate or biased [1]. In this work, we propose a neuro-based method for objectively measure robot behavior in HRI. Using electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired from a human interaction partner we aim at detecting the perception of inappropriate/unexpected/erroneous robot behaviors. In order to validate this method, we conducted a human-robot interaction experiment, in which a humanoid robot displayed context-dependent erroneous actions from time to time. The EEG data collected from 13 participants revealed biologically plausible error-related neurophysiological responses (ErrP) that resemble previously reported ErrPs from different, but related experimental contexts [2,3]. In case of robot erroneous actions, we observed the characteristic N2 component that has been reported consistently in relation to cases of high conflict (e.g. incongruent stimuli) [4]. Also, we observed an increased P300 component which has consistently been associated with stimuli expectancy. We further demonstrated that these responses can successfully be modeled with standard pattern recognition techniques and detected from the human EEG with above-chance classification accuracies of avg. 69.7%. With these findings we confirm principal feasibility of our proposed method and suggest that EEG-based ErrP detection can be used for quantitative evaluation and improvement of robot behavior and HRI.",

        "text": "Rats collect tactile information about their surrounding environment while actively rubbing and taping their whiskers against objects. The nature of the physical signals that rats use for the discrimination of surface textures is still poorly understood. We investigated the mechanical modalities of the signal transference from the whiskers tip and object contact zone to the base and mechanoreceptors interface. To this end we extracted the spatiotemporal evolution of the local curvature of plugged rat vibrissae from their motion acquired by high speed and high resolution videography less than two kHz frame rate. The vibrissa was mounted on a rotating axis and swept by a stepper motor at different angular velocities and distances across sandpaper surfaces of different grades. Our measurements suggest that dynamic friction, expressed as stick slip movements of the vibrissa tip is converted to bending waves propagating along the whisker towards its base. We constructed a mathematical model which converts local curvature into moments along the vibrissa shaft. We found that the bending moment variations are transmitted quasi instantaneously from tip to base and are strongly amplified. In a second approach we aimed at explicitly modelling the tip contact zone giving rise to frictional movements and linking it to a model of the conically tapered shaft. Preliminary results showed good agreement of these model outcomes with the previously observed torque amplification.",

        "text": "It has been discovered that the functional architecture of the visual cortex in carnivores and primates obeys invariant layout laws [1]. Currently the only quantitative explanation for the generation of this specific type of functional architecture is a symmetry defined class of optimization models [2]. It is known that models from this class exhibit a strong multistability. However, what is the exact number of essentially different solutions has been unsolved. Here we examine this question by means of group theoretic and combinatorial methods. We demonstrate the equivalence of the model solution set with self-dual configurations of so called necklaces [3]. This mapping provides an exact expression in terms of the Euler totient function that shows that the number of solutions grows to leading order exponentially. Furthermore, we define a natural metric that relates similar solutions to each other and examine whether a principled categorization of the solution set can be derived. A graph based on minimal distance in this metric is found to be densely connected. This shows the absence of structure in the solution space that could form the basis of a natural categorization. We conclude that lexicographic ordering is the most natural grouping possible. It is remarkable that a highly symmetric optimization problem, as studied here, exhibits an excessively large set of equivalent solutions. Our results provide a key ingredient for further studies of their detailed features.\n",

        "text": "\nThe insect olfactory system is an excellent model for the study of sensory processing. The first olfactory relay - the antennal lobe (AL) - is clearly structured and accessible for electrophysiological methods. In the AL processing of olfactory inputs occurs through a complex network local interneurons (LNs), intrinsic, and synaptic mechanisms. Interactions in the AL shape olfactory representations, e.g. regulating the tuning profile of projection neurons (PNs), the principal output neurons of the AL.\n\nAlthough the cellular composition of the insect olfactory network has been studied extensively, knowledge of intrinsic cell properties and their dedicated functions is still fragmented. Thus, the characterization of PNs and the LNs is key in understanding odour responses and processing in the AL. In the cockroach $periplaneta\\ americana$ recent work established morphology and physiological response properties of distinct LN types [1,2] and found a range of different spike frequency adaptation behaviours in LNs and PNs [3].\n\nHere we add on to the characterisation of AL neurons in $periplaneta\\ americana$ with a model driven approach. To this end, we estimate intrinsic neuron parameters from patch clamp recordings of LNs and PNs and test the performance of integrate and fire type models. In addition, we propose the fit of a generalized integrate-and-fire model [5] stimulating AL neurons with filtered Gaussian white noise currents [4]. Such inputs allow us to take into account the fluctuating nature of synaptic inputs. We anticipate this work to ground realistic models of AL neurons in the cockroach $periplaneta\\ americana$\n .",

        "text": "The role of recurrent interactions in processing visual information in primary visual cortex is largely unclear at present. Moreover, the layout of orientation preference in primary visual cortex varies considerably across mammalian species, but it remains to be determined, whether this variation reflects different processing strategies [1]. Here we model the influence of different connectivity patterns in conjunction with different architectures for orientation selectivity on visual processing abilities. Specifically, we study which biologically plausible network structure exhibits superior performance in an angle discrimination task using moving oriented gratings.\n\nOur model consists of a single-layer recurrent firing-rate network receiving an initially tuned feed-forward input in form of visual patterns passed through properly oriented Gabor filters. We vary the feed-forward tuning strength and test two different layouts of feed forward selectivity: a smooth orientation preference map (observed in primates and carnivores) and a salt-and-pepper organization (observed in rodents). Recurrent connectivity is considered as either purely distance-dependent or distance- and angle-dependent with excitation between cells with similar and inhibition between cells with orthogonal preferred orientations [2]. Varying the relative strength of lateral and feed-forward connections, we measure the performance in angle discrimination using a logistic regression classifier of population activity.\n\nWe find that a minimal amount of feed forward tuning is necessary for angle discrimination. A combination of orientation dependent inhibitory and excitatory lateral connections shows the largest performance in angle discrimination. Recurrent connectivity in the form of distant-dependent ‚ÄòMexican-hat-type‚Äô projections improves the performance with stronger effect for the smooth orientation map. Angle-dependent connectivity improves discrimination to a similar degree in both smooth maps and the salt-and-pepper organization. Improved discriminability is accompanied by an increase of the orientation selectivity in individual units, larger simple-to-complex cell ratio, increased population sparsity and a weak increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, but the increase of none of these properties by itself implies high discrimination performance. We conclude that recurrent interactions generate a complex population behavior which can be beneficial for processing visual information.",

        "text": "Retinal waves are spontaneous bursts of activity propagating in the developing retina and thought to play a central role in shaping the visual system and retinal circuitry. They first occur at early embryonic stages of development and gradually disappear upon maturation. Understanding their generating mechanisms may help us control and use them in order to re-train the retina for rewiring and possibly improve vision restoration, after treatment, in some degenerative retinal diseases.\nFrom the dynamical systems perspective, a retinal wave is spatiotemporal activity which is generated by the conjunction of local (cell level) nonlinear characteristics and network effects, can have different forms (fronts, spiral, standing waves) and is induced by generic dynamical mechanisms, associated with typical bifurcations. We have developed a biophysical model of these waves, close enough to biology to reproduce several prominent experimental results observed in [1], and accessible to dynamical systems analysis. The model features a network of cholinergic-coupled Starburst Amacrine Cells (SAC) with a Calcium-controlled slow After HyperPolarization current (sAHP) [2], [3]. SAC burst spontaneously and periodically and their coupling gives rise to spatio-temporal activity. Especially, arousal of waves is related to a specific type of bifurcation. More generally, we observe a wide variability of spatiotemporal patterns, depending on two important biophysical parameters: the rest potential (which can be changed upon pharmacological manipulations) and the coupling intensity (changing upon maturation). This variability is illustrated in Figure 1, where we compute the pairwise distance correlations between cells for different levels of cholinergic coupling strength. This shows that we can classify the emerging patterns according to the coupling strength, namely the cholinergic conductance. Therefore, our main conclusions are that one can observe substantial change in spatio-temporal activity within stage II depending either on maturation or on pharmacological control.  Our biophysical model is able to predict this change in the patterns within stage II and propose a specific recipe for experiments to validate our findings. This suggests new possible experiments to explore yet unexplored aspects in developmental retinal waves.",

        "text": "There have been many recent attempts at creating large-scale network models of spiking neurons to understand the functioning of the brain. In creating these large-scale brain models, there is a trade off between the level of detail and the size of the simulation due to the constraint of computational resources. While most of the large scale brain models use billions of cells with simplified spiking neuron models [1-4], a few have used multi-compartmental neuron models at a smaller scale (around 100,000 cells) with extreme detail in terms of cell morphology and ion channel mechanisms in the cell membrane [5, 6]. Dendrites play an important role in determining a neuron‚Äôs sensitivity to stimuli [7]. Therefore, it is a good idea to include dendritic morphology in simulations. We propose a reduced order model based on spike-triggered analysis [8] that preserves the features of morphology while improving computational efficiency. \n\nThe spike-triggered analysis is used very frequently in experimental neuroscience [9, 10] to understand the relation between stimulus and spiking of sensory neurons. There are some cases where this method has been applied to computational models like integrate and fire neurons [11] and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons [12] to find isolated spikes (spikes preceded by a long silence) from current input. The spike-triggered analysis method commonly used is explained in Figure 1 (A and B).\n\nWe extend the spike-triggered analysis procedure to include effects of morphology and refractory period (Fig 1C). We apply the method on a multi-compartmental model containing cell body with Hodgkin-Huxley mechanism and one passive dendrite. To understand the effect of dendritic morphology, we find the STA and static nonlinearity for different locations along the dendrite by injecting white noise current at different locations of interest. To understand the effect of the cell‚Äôs refractory period, we compute the STA for different inter-spike intervals. We choose the STA dynamically based on time passed since the last spike and the static non-linearity based on the location of the current input. We compare the accuracy of our reduced model to the full model for white noise and synaptic inputs. We also propose a method of using our reduced order model in a network. For a single cell, the reduced order model is approximately ten times faster than the full HH model.",

        "text": "Two classical approaches to simulate neuronal networks are the time-driven and event-driven methods [1]. Both methods describe the physical system in terms of set of state variables representing the neurons and events that mediate their interaction, i.e. spikes.\n\nIn the discrete-time (on-grid mode) of the NEST simulator [2], the dynamics of each neuron is propagated by a pre-defined simulation step.  Various pitfalls of this approach such as artificial synchronization have been addressed previously by embedding event-driven methods in a globally time-driven simulation[4,5]. This method is applicable to a certain class of neuron models [3] whose sub-threshold dynamics can be exactly integrated by applying methods that process spikes in continuous-time.\n\nHowever, the accuracy of these continuous-time \"precise\" models (off-grid mode) of the NEST simulator has not been systematically investigated yet. One source of imprecision is the possibility to miss spikes caused by brief and unnoticed excursions of the membrane potential beyond threshold. We here develop a new spike detection algorithm based on state-space analysis of variables governing the linear system of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with exponential currents. \n\nConventional spike detection methods in time-driven simulations propagate the state of neuron forward i.e. from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ (or) $t_{\\mathrm{incoming\\_event}}$ and check whether there has been a threshold crossing only at the end of time interval. If the neuron dynamics is such that its voltage is below threshold at $t$ and $t+\\Delta t$ (or) $t_{\\mathrm{incoming\\_event}}$ and supra-threshold between, this leads to a spike miss. The idea of this work is to understand whether such voltage excursions occur and if so, how frequent they are and what is their effect on accuracy the of the LIF model. \n\nInstead of propagating the neuron state forward, we propagate the threshold plane backward in time to find the set of initial conditions (spiking states) that would cross threshold in the future. By doing so, we get two distinct regions in state-space: the initial states leading to a spike, and those not leading to a spike, within a simulation step as illustrated in Fig(1).\n\nThis algorithm confirms that the precise LIF model in NEST rarely misses spikes. The reason is that frequently arriving synaptic impulses effectively induce a fine-grained grid of check points making brief excursions above threshold extremely unlikely.",

        "text": "Background: Information theoretic approaches have been applied to a wide range of problems in neuroscience, including consciousness. A prominent example is the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness developed by Tononi et al. IIT proposes a measure called œÜ to quantify the state-dependent information integration of a system of elements. However, the calculation of œÜ has undergone important changes over time, and the most recent instantiation by Oizumi et al. (IIT 3.0) features some aspects that are not easily apprehended, such as the assumption of virtual elements or conditional probabilities over the empty set of variables. We therefore aim at a parsimonious and traceable formulation of œÜ in a probabilistic model.\nFormulation and Results: We interpret the elements of a system as random variables in a Markov process that can be described by probability distributions in standard notation. Under the assumption of conditional independence, we define a joint conditional distribution over all elements, corresponding to a Markov transition probability matrix. Together with the definition of a uniform distribution over past states, we derive a multidimensional joint distribution (MJD) encompassing two adjacent temporal states of a system. We suggest that all derivations for the calculation of integrated information are obtained from this MJD. Based on this, we show that the assumption of virtual elements is no longer necessary for IIT. We also examine the partitioning of a network and derive the number of possible bipartitions of a set of elements as an identity of the Stirling number of the 2nd kind. We assert that in IIT every bipartition corresponds to a factorization of the MJD and derive a general formulation of this, based on which the notion of conditioning with the empty set of variables is no longer necessary. We thus arrive at a general formulation of œÜ in a standard probabilistic framework. When applied to the same simple example system in IIT 3.0, our formulation allowed for a reproduction of œÜ without the need for virtual elements, conditioning with the empty set of variables, or normalization constants.\nDiscussion: We suggest that our formulation of œÜ may improve traceability and parsimony of IIT 3.0. Independent attempts to improve measures of integrated information have been made very recently by Oizumi et al. and Tegmark, although more focused on IIT 2.0. Further work is necessary to extend our formulation to non-discrete systems.",

        "text": "Synchronous firing of neurons is a prominent feature in many brain areas. Here, we are interested in the information transmission by the synchronous spiking output of a noisy neuronal population,  which receives a common time-dependent sensory stimulus. Earlier experimental [1] and theoretical [2] work revealed that synchronous spikes encode preferentially fast (high-frequency) components of the stimulus, i.e. synchrony can act as an information filter. In these studies a rather strict measure of synchrony was used: the entire population has to fire within a short time window. Here, we generalize the definition of the synchronous output, for which only a certain fraction Œ≥ of the population needs to be active simultaneously ‚Äì a setup that seems to be of more biological relevance. We characterize the information transfer in dependence of this fraction by the spectral coherence function between the common stimulus and the partial synchronous output. We present analytical approximations to derive this frequency-resolved measure. We show that there is a critical synchrony fraction, namely the mean of the summed activity of the population, which maximizes the information transmission of the synchronous output.  At this value, the partial synchronous output acts as a low-pass filter, whereas  deviations from this critical fraction lead to a more and more pronounced band-pass filtering effect. We confirm our analytical findings by numerical simulations for the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron.  We also show that these findings are supported by experimental recordungs of P-Units electroreceptors of weakly electric fish [3], where the filtering effect of the synchronous output occurs in real neurons as well.

        "text": "Two important parts of electrophysiological recordings are the spike times and the local field potential (LFP), which is considered to primarily reflect input activity. In [1], it was shown by unitary event analysis [2,3] that excess synchronous spike events are locked to the phase of LFP beta-oscillations more strongly than spikes not part of such events. Denker et al. proved by a statistical model that this finding could be explained by the existence of cell assemblies, i.e. groups of (excitatory) neurons that are more strongly connected amongst each other than to the rest of the network.\nTo study the influence of the LFP on the correlated single neuron activities first for a simple model capturing the main properties of cortical neural networks, we examine a balanced network of homogeneously connected binary model neurons [4] receiving input from a sinusoidal perturbation [5]. The Glauber dynamics of the network is simulated and approximated by mean-field theory. Treating the periodic input in linear response theory, the cyclostationary first two moments are analytically computed, which agree with their simulated counterparts over a wide parameter range. The deviations of the zero-time lag correlations from their stationary values consist of two summands owing to the modulated susceptibility (one via direct modulation, one via modulated mean activity) and one to the driving of the autocorrelations. For some parameters, this leads to resonant correlations and non-resonant mean activities. Our results can help to answer the question how oscillations in mesoscopic signals and spike correlations interact. As a next step, our model could be extended to include cell assemblies [6], which will allow us to compare our results with the experimental findings more closely.",

        "text": "Learning the receptive fields of V1 simple-¬≠cells, given natural scene input, is a well studied setting. For this,\nseveral models based on spike¬≠-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) have been published. However, these\nmodels have several limitations as they rely on rate¬≠-based learning dynamics (referring to symmetric STDP),\nlack an inhibitory circuit, or have only been described in a single¬≠-neuron setting [1,2,3].\nWe   implemented   a   spiking   network   consisting   of   144   excitatory   and   36   inhibitory   recurrent   connected\nneurons, receiving inputs from a population of Poisson neurons. Excitatory synapse strengths are learned\nusing a homoeostatic voltage¬≠-based triplet STDP rule [4], and inhibitory synapse strengths using symmetric\ninhibitory   STDP   [5].   The   network   was   stimulated   with   pre¬≠-whitened   natural   scene   patches   [6]   and\nimplemented with the neural simulator ANNarchy [7].\nThe   neurons   in   the  network   develop   V1   simple   like   receptive   fields.   Further,   excitatory  and   inhibitory\nneurons   with   similar   tuning  develop   strong   bidirectional   synaptic   weights.   We   observed   that   a   state   of\nbalanced   excitation   and   inhibition   was   virtually   impossible   to   achieve   using   the   pulse¬≠like   synaptic\ntransmission used in the STDP model by Clopath et al. [4], which led to strongly fluctuating excitatory and\ninhibitory synaptic currents with little temporal correlation in our setting. As a consequence, we employed\nlonger synaptic time constants, which improved the representation acuity of the network in terms of the\nimage reconstruction error.\nHowever, this also had effects on the learning dynamics, such as differences in the feed¬≠-forward receptive\nfield sizes and learning speed, presumably through compensatory effects of the homoeostatic mechanism of\nthe excitatory learning rule on the inhibitory learning. Finally, the model's coding performance compares\nfavourably to existing models [1].",

        "text": "Although genetic information is critically important for brain development and structure, it is widely believed that neocortical functional architecture is largely shaped by activity dependent mechanisms. The information capacity of the genome appears too small to contain a blueprint for hardwiring the cortex.\n Here we show theoretically that genetic mechanisms can circumvent this apparent information bottleneck. Using our prior research on universality classes of circuit self-organization in the visual cortex [1], we devised mathematical models of genetic networks of neurons interacting by long-range axonal morphogen transport.  Neurons dynamically generate morphogen patterns that prescribe the layout of orientation domains as experimentally observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of primates and carnivores [2,3,4]. We use analytical methods from weakly non-linear analysis [5] complemented by numerical simulations to obtain solutions of example genetic networks. In particular we find that active transport and fast synaptic rearrangements are crucial for orientation domain development. Furthermore, we scan for specific genetic networks that produce orientation domains, which are best compatible with experimental data.\nThe hypothesis of genetic circuits shaping the complex architecture of V1 is in line with several recent biological findings. For instance, (1) transcription factors have been found to be transported via axons and to translocate into the nucleus of  target neurons [6], (2) a molecular correlate was recently found for ocular dominance columns in V1 [7], (3) V1's architecture is intriguingly robust against radically abnormal developmental conditions such as dark rearing [2,4,8].\nOur theory for the first time shows how a complex cortical processing architecture can be specified using a genetic mechanism of small bandwidth and opens a novel perspective on the experimentally observed robustness of V1's architecture against radically abnormal developmental conditions [8].

        "text": "Depending on behavioral context, sensory signal information is selectively routed throughout the brain. For the visual system, studies have shown that V4 neurons can ‚Äòselect‚Äô the behaviorally relevant stimulus out of multiple active inputs [1]. The corresponding mechanisms are still debated, however, frequency-band synchronization has emerged as a promising candidate, proposing that information routing (IR) occurs between populations with a favorable phase-locked relationship and is suppressed otherwise (communication-through-coherence, CTC) [2]. \nElectrical stimulation offers the possibility of causally testing CTC by externally perturbing the neural dynamics, and by quantifying its impact on IR. However, there are two major obstacles. First, one has to quickly and accurately determine the actual network state from noisy, non-stationary activity. Second, the behavior of a coupled system is much more constrained than the dynamics of its constituting modules in isolation, making it difficult to control by external stimulation.\nHere, we address these two problems in a biophysically realistic model [3] (Fig A) by exploring a paradigm that employs precisely timed perturbations derived from phase-response curves (PRCs) to control the relative phase of neural populations, allowing for direct control over IR [4]. In contrast to enforcing a desired state by strong stimulation, we use minimal perturbations to push a multistable system into one of its preferred states.\nTo determine the network's state in real-time, we investigated multiple methods, finding that a combination of predictive autoregression (AR), bandpass filter and Hilbert transform provides the best results [5]. It is fast and accurate, and perfectly applicable to animal experiments even in presence of recording/stimulation artifacts. Further, we focused on the network's dynamics and analyzed its tendency to spontaneously switch between states where either population X or Y is in favorable phase with Z. Using previously calculated PRCs together with AR real-time Gamma phase estimation (Fig B), we exploit this bistability for controlling which populations will enter a favorable phase relationship. In particular, we propose two alternative scenarios in which this is possible by stimulating higher level, or by stimulating lower level areas (Fig A+B). By imposing independent signal streams onto the input populations, we prove that our controlled synchronization routes information as desired.",

        "text": "\tSpikelets are small spike-like depolarizations that can be measured in somatic intracellular recordings. In general, spikelets are considered to reflect action potentials (APs) generated in an electrotonically distinct compartment. However, the precise origin of spikelets in pyramidal neurons is not well understood.\n    Chorev and Brecht (2012) performed dual intra- and extracellular recordings in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo and identified extracellular correlates of AP and spikelet firing. They observed that the onset of the AP-associated extracellular waveform slightly precedes the onset of the spikelet-associated waveform, which provides strong constraints for the mechanism(s) of spikelet generation in pyramidal neurons.\n    To gain further insights into the implications of this data for spikelet origin, we simulated extracellular waveforms associated with APs and spikelets in compartmental models of pyramidal neurons. We considered spikelets generated in neurons coupled by gap junctions as well as spikelets originating at the axon initial segment in a single cell.\n    According to our results, the single-cell hypothesis of spikelet origin is consistent with the experimental data by Chorev and Brecht (2012). Also the electrotonic coupling mechanism can account for all considered data features, but only for an axo-axonal location of the gap junction and a large distance (> ca. 140 Œºm) between the somata of the coupled cells, such that  the extracellular AP waveform only reflects the intracellularly recorded cell . This scenario is virtually indistinguishable from a single-cell case, in which spikelets are evoked through distal axonal stimulation  (antidromic spikelets).\n    Our simulations demonstrate that a cell producing a spikelet generates a measurable  extracellular waveform, and importantly, that this waveform is different from when the same cell shows an AP. This implies that spikelets and APs generated in a single cell will be incorrectly classified as two different units in extracellular recordings, albeit they together constitute the output of a single pyramidal cell.",

        "text": "One prominent feature of pathological states such as Parkinson's disease is the emergence of correlated neural activity among basal ganglia output neurons (Bergman et al., 1998). Importantly, in healthy animals the activity in basal ganglia output regions is usually uncorrelated, potentially due to active decorrelation (Wilson, 2013). However, the functional role of active decorrelation on information transmission from the basal ganglia to downstream regions is unknown. Basal ganglia output neurons transmit motor commands, for example by decreasing their firing rate during movement initiation (Schmidt et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that such decreases in firing rate may generate low-threshold rebound spikes in thalamocortical neurons (e.g. Goldberg et al., 2013). Here we investigate the effect of different degrees of correlation among basal ganglia output neurons on the generation of rebound spikes in a Hodgkin-Huxley model of a thalamocortical neuron (Rubin et al., 2004). Our results show that, for uncorrelated input, the thalamocortical model neuron elicits a rebound spike exclusively briefly after the movement-related decrease. However, even small correlations in the input lead to rebound spikes also at other, random times, which may impair the clear transmission of motor commands. Moreover, correlations in the input increase variability in the timing of the rebound spikes triggered by the movement-related decrease. We conclude that active decorrelation in the basal ganglia output may promote transmission of motor commands via thalamic rebound spikes with high temporal precision. Furthermore, pathological correlations and the resulting impaired transmission of motor commands may be related to some of the motor symptoms in Parkinson‚Äôs disease (Magnin et al., 2000).",

A putative neural mechanism for the production of sequences is the exploitation of an autonomously generated sequence of neural activations from which the desired motor output can be read out. It has been hypothesized that songbirds use this mechanism to produce songs, with neurons in RA that seem to read out from neurons in HVC [1,2]. In the songbird case the autonomously generated sequence in HVC is a chain-like pattern whose length scales linearly with the number of neurons. This strategy seems inadequate to apply for more complex sequential behaviors, since it would require a very large amount of neurons. We ask what is the longest sequence that can be autonomously generated.\nWe show that Hopfield neural networks with synchronous dynamics and asymmetric weights admit stable orbits that form sequences of maximal length. For $N$ units these orbits have length $T=2^N$ i.e. they cover the full state space. The result is obtained using a mathematical proof that proceeds by induction and that is constructive, i.e. it provides an algorithm to obtain both the orbit and the weight matrix that allows its production. \nThe exponentially long orbit comes with the cost of an exponential fine tuning of the weights. Surprisingly however, the orbit is relatively robust to dynamical noise while perturbations of the optimal weights reveal other periodic orbits that are not maximal but typically still very long. Due to the learnability limit of the perceptron [3], not all the sequences of length $2^N$ can be read out from the autonomously generated one. Interestingly however, the resulting dynamics exhibits slow time scales, that can be used to generate non-trivial output sequences.",

        "text": "Reservoir networks are a well-established model of neural networks performing complex time-resolved computations [1]. In particular, they have been discussed as a possible model of the processes implementing human and animal working memory [2]. The basic working principles of reservoir networks stem from the concept of non-autonmous and non-linear transient systems [3]. While various implementations and applications of reservoir networks have been shown, a thorough understanding of their actual abilities and limitations is missing. Typical tasks solved by reservoir networks include additive or multiplicative noise in the input signals or within the reservoir itself. However, in most tasks, the timinig of the input signals is very precise or even constant. In contrast, in real-world situations, neural network continuously interact with other networks, i.e. brain areas, or the environment. The signals received via these pathways, however, do not necessarily exhibit a reliable and precise timing. Here, we investigate the consequences of abolishing precise timing of input signals in benchmark tasks for the performance of reservoir networks. The network is trained to remember the sign of received stimulus pulses and produce an output signal depending on the sign of  the second-last received stimulus. We train the network by both the Echo State Approach [4] as well as the FORCE-method [5]. Interestingly, we find that in both cases the performance of  the reservoir declines dramatically with increasing variance in the input. Analyzing the dynamics of a trained network projected onto its principal components, we observe that the transient storage mechanism relies on only small distances between the different trajectories evoked by incoming stimuli. Introducing noise in the input timing directly affects this storage mechanism.  In order to increase the distances between trajectories representing different memory content, additional read-out signals maintaining relevant memory content can be introduced. It turns out that this way, the originally purely transient network is turned into a system with multiple attractor states. We propose that optimal performance is achieved if the maintenance of memory content and the production of complex output trajectories is separately implemented by attractor states and transients, respectively.",

        "text": "Spike trains of cortical neurons are composed of a mixture of short bursts and single spikes. One mechanism for converting single spikes into bursts relies on active dendrites receiving top-down information. Specifically, single-cell experiments suggested that bursts signal a coincidence between bottom-up signals and the top-down signals impinging on apical dendrites (Larkum et al., 1999) but it is not clear how this mechanism scales to the network level. We investigate coding by burst and single spikes in networks of deep cortical cells in the presence of feedback inhibition onto their active dendrites. Our computational models are calibrated on electrophysiological recordings (Naud et al., 2014) to reproduce the signatures of calcium spikes in apical dendrites (Larkum et al., 1999, Larkum et al., 1999b) and the properties of Martinotti cells (Pala and Petersen, 2015). At the network level, we find that dendrite-mediated bursts compute a difference between top-down and bottom-up inputs. Coincidence detection is recovered when the Martinotti-cell inhibition is impaired either by reducing the net excitatory drive to inhibitory cells or by weakening the inhibitory synapses. Using regression analysis, we then determine a phenomenological model of the burst rate, which reveals that the burst rate computes a nonlinear function of the bottom-up and top-down inputs. Lastly, the top-down modulation of the firing rate is studied. We find that, in the presence of potent Martinotti-cell inhibition, the gain is affected by top-down inputs only in the weak input regime. This suggests a multiplexing of the neural code where spikes encode bottom-up signals but bursts encode a difference between top-down and bottom-up signals.",

        "text": "Subgroups of neurons in barreloids of the rat ventroposterior medial thalamus (VPM) respond synchronously with temporal precision to different kinetic features of naturalistic whisker motion (spike-time coding) [1]. Temporally precise responses in the somatosensory cortex, such as those observed during passive whisker deflection or active whisking, are thought to be triggered by synchronously firing VPM cells, but the minimum number of convergent synchronously firing VPM cells needed to reliably drive the spiking of a given cortical cell is not known. Here, we used the Blue Brain Project‚Äôs digital reconstruction of a somatosensory microcircuit of a juvenile rat [2] to characterize this minimum number of convergent synchronous inputs for different morphological types in the somatosensory cortex. We activated an increasing number of synchronously firing VPM fibers in both simulations of single cells, and of the whole reconstructed microcircuit. We found that inhibitory neurons in layers 3 and 4 quickly approached maximum spike-timing reliability for around 10-15 synchronously firing VPM neurons. Excitatory neurons in layers 3 and 4 required substantially more synchronous VPM fibers, but less than excitatory neurons in layers 5 and 6. With an average of eight synapses per connection, these numbers are significantly higher than what was observed in a previous in silico study in the cat visual cortex [3]. We show that this can be attributed to a lower synaptic release probability in vivo than in vitro, due to lower extracellular calcium concentration [4], which is taken into account in our simulations but not in previous studies.",

        "text": "High-level brain function such as memory, classification or reasoning can be realized by means of recurrent networks of simplified model neurons. Analog neuromorphic hardware constitutes a fast and energy efficient substrate for the implementation of such neural computing architectures in technical applications and neuroscientific research. The functional performance of neural networks is often critically dependent on the level of correlations in the neural activity. In finite networks, correlations are typically inevitable due to shared presynaptic input. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these shared-input correlations and thereby enable neurons to fire nearly independently. For networks of spiking neurons, the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback has so far been explicitly demonstrated only for homogeneous networks of neurons with linear sub-threshold dynamics. Theory, however, suggests that the effect is a general phenomenon, present in any system with sufficient inhibitory feedback, irrespective of the details of the network structure or the neuronal and synaptic properties.\nHere, we investigate the effect of network heterogeneity on correlations in sparse, random networks of inhibitory neurons with non-linear, conductance-based synapses [Pfeil et al. (2016), Phys. Rev. X 6, 021023]. Emulations of these networks on the analog neuromorphic hardware system Spikey allow us to test the efficiency of decorrelation by inhibitory feedback in the presence of hardware-specific heterogeneities. The configurability of the hardware substrate enables us to modulate the extent of heterogeneity in a systematic manner. We selectively study the effects of shared input and recurrent connections on correlations in membrane potentials and spike trains. Our results confirm that shared-input correlations are actively suppressed by inhibitory feedback also in highly heterogeneous networks exhibiting broad, heavy-tailed firing-rate distributions. In line with former studies, cell heterogeneities reduce shared-input correlations. Overall, however, correlations in the recurrent system can increase with the level of heterogeneity as a consequence of diminished effective negative feedback.\n",

        "text": "It has been proposed [1] that the brain operates at criticality, as the critical point is associated with desirable properties such as optimal information processing capacity and maximal dynamic range [2,3,4]. In many critical systems activity occurs in avalanches, with the avalanche size $S$ following a probability distribution given by $p(S)\\sim S^{-\\gamma}$. This was observed both in vivo and in vitro with Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings [5,6], suggesting that the brain operates at criticality. However, the avalanche analysis introduces many parameters in order to extract discrete events from the continuous recording. Moreover, little is known about the processes contributing to the LFP [7,8]. Thus it is possible that the brain operates in a subcritical regime (which is supported by spiking data [9]), mistaken for critical by the avalanche analysis. Here we model the LFP using a two-layer system, where the network dynamics of firing nodes is measured by an array of simulated electrodes. We characterize the impact of analysis parameters and experimental conditions, and identify the inter-electrode distance (IED) as capable of masking subcriticality by generating power-law shaped $p(S)$ from subcritical systems (Fig. 1a,b). This is important in view of the availability of increasingly denser multi-electrode arrays. We suggest two ways of differentiating apparent from truly critical systems: (1) while varying the bin size $b$ and IED $d$ can change the shape of the avalanche size distribution, only for the critical system we observe an invariance of $p(S)$ as long as they obey $b_{2}/b_{1}=2^{d_{2}-d_{1}}$(Fig. 1c,d). (2) analyzing the LFP power-spectral density (PSD) we observe a $1/f^{\\beta}$ decay in power. The exponent $\\beta$ depends on the features of the system, e.g. if the signal decays as $1/R$ or $1/R^{2}$ with distance $R$ from the source, and whether a frequency filter is present. Therefore, $\\beta$ can shed light into potential differences between in vivo and in vitro systems. Regarding criticality, the critical system displays a $1/f^{\\beta}$spectrum, whereas the subcritical one is marked by a flatter spectrum for lower frequencies. While the $1/f^{\\beta}$spectrum is not sufficient to assert a system as critical, only the critical system is expected to generate both $1/f^{\\beta}$ spectrum and power-law avalanche distribution. Thus, combining avalanche and PSD analyses we can differentiate critical, subcritical and Poisson dynamics. ",

        "text": "Neuronal morphology shapes connectivity in a way that is dependent on the extent of the overlap of axonal and dendritic arbors (Hill et al., 2012; Stepanyants and Chklovskii, 2005). However, the extent to which the specific morphologies of different neuron types determine the emergence of specific motifs is still unclear. In a recent reconstruction of neocortical microcircuitry (Markram et al., 2015), we utilized this principle along with other biological constraints to derive a statistical neocortical microconnectome (Reimann et al., 2015). In this study, we will use information theory to investigate the structure of connectivity introduced by morphological diversity captured in the digital reconstruction. Our analysis reveals that morphological diversity severely constrains the space of possible connectomes. This is because different morphological types display characteristic distance dependent connectivity profiles, and prefered pre- and postsynaptic combinations of morphological types. Distance dependence and the bias for reciprocal connectivity can be explained by overlapping clouds of arbor densities, but the over-expression of clustered connectivity motifs requires specificity of neuronal arborization. We conclude that the principles determining the connectome cannot be understood without considering the detailed morphologies of individual neuron types.",

        "text": "Neural morphology and membrane properties vary greatly between cell types in the nervous system. While the function of neurons is thought to be the key constraint for their biophysical properties, additional constraints may further shape neuronal design and explain observed properties. Here, we focus on principal neurons in the MSO nucleus of the auditory brainstem and show that a tradeoff between a functionally relevant computation and energy consumption predicts optimal ranges of biophysical parameters.\n\nBiophysical properties of MSO cells as well as their function are well characterized: MSO cells encode the direction of sound in the horizontal plane. Inputs to MSO cells are phase-locked to sound wave stimuli to each ear and the interaural time difference (ITD) of sound waves is used to compute source location. To achieve sensitivity to ITDs in the range of tens of Œºs, MSO cells have specialized membrane properties, including a very fast membrane time constant (~1 ms) and a low-threshold K$^+$ current (I$_{\\rm KLT}$), both contributing to a very short input integration window.\n\nNext to function, energy use can be assumed to significantly constrain MSO cell properties. Overall, the brain accounts for a disproportionately large part (~20%) of the energy budget [1], with metabolic energy being mostly spent on synaptic input, action potentials, and resting potentials [2]. MSO cells, in particular, receive inputs at very high rates (hundreds of Hz), generate action potentials at similarly high rates, and display a very leaky membrane.\n\nHere, we quantify and contrast sensitivity of MSO cells to ITDs as well as the associated metabolic cost. Using cable theoretic methods, we developed a mathematical model of MSO cells that included a quasi-active description of I$_{\\rm KLT}$ [3]. Exploring the biophysical parameter space, we find that KLT parameters improve ITD sensitivity most efficiently with respect to energetic cost. Morphological parameters, in contrast, are key for minimizing costs, while having little effect on ITD sensitivity. For an energy-efficient ITD sensitivity we find optimal parameter ranges for dendritic diameter and KLT density, activation function, and activation time constant, matching with experimentally observed values. We conclude that the neural design of MSO cells is indeed compatible with functional and energetic constraints, and limited energetic resources may have played a substantial role in the evolution of these cells.",

        "text": "Understanding communication and information processing in cortical networks requires the development of acquisition technologies which allow for minimally interfering, robust, and chronic recordings and/or electrical stimulation. For this purpose, we developed a novel type of multi-channel, freely floating probe that penetrates the cortical tissue perpendicular to the cortical surface (similar to state-of-the-art \"Michigan-type\" probes) and allows for the simultaneous recording of 16 channels up to a depth of about 1.4mm [1,2] (Fig.1a left). The advantage of our design is the direct connection of the silicon shaft to the cable without a rigid basement, thus allowing an implantation where the probe can freely float with the tissue which minimizes relative movement and avoids injury to the neural tissue.\nWe present results from chronic recordings in motor cortex of anesthetized rats to characterize the capabilities of the new recording technology. We analyzed 4 sessions of spontaneous activity (400-1000s each) made in one week, ca. 30 days after implantation. After low-pass filtering the raw signals (1-300Hz), we obtained local field potentials whose power spectra show a peak in the theta range (~7-10Hz) across most channels and weak gamma activity around 40Hz at channels 5-8 and 13-15.\nWith the spike-sorting tool WaveClus [3], we extracted spikes from the high-pass filtered signal (>300Hz) with mean rates up to 90Hz. The number of clusters per channel ranges from 0-4, with a mean of 1.4. There is evidence for slowly varying network (up and down) states, with periods of high activity separated by almost silent periods. We also observe high peaks at zero delay in spike cross-correlation (CC) functions between neighboring channels (Fig.1b). This might indicate that signals from one neuron can be picked up by multiple contacts or that two neurons pick up common input and fire at the same time. To investigate this further, we will use algorithms developed for multi-contact probes [4]. Cross-correlations also show that pairs of neurons tend to fire with a consistent delay between 5 and 21 ms, indicating that these sites are part of two subpopulations in a cortical column which become engaged in a particular temporal sequence during spontaneous activation (Fig.1c/1d). Most importantly, we showed that the quality of recordings is stable over time (Fig.1a right), demonstrating that high-quality, stable, chronic recordings are possible with the novel technology.",

        "text": "To understand neural coding it is crucial to understand how a neuron's spike generation is influenced by its own and the network's past activity. Here we explore information theoretic techniques to quantify memory in the spiking activity of a single neuron and use this analysis to compare memory effects of spike generation in vitro and in vivo (awake rat hippocampus).\nWe quantify memory as the mutual information (MI) between the future state (spike or no spike) and the past activity [1] that is represented as a pattern of binary spike counts (Fig. 1A). To make results comparable across neurons and recordings we study the relative information M=MI/H, i.e. we normalize by the Shannon information H of the spiking process without history. The memory M can be inferred from spiking data, either by fitting a statistical model, e.g. a generalized linear model (GLM), or in a model-free way by estimating directly the probabilities of past activity patterns. Though the latter approach is more generic, it is not applicable to arbitrarily long patterns as data are limited and consequently the analysis becomes corrupted by estimation bias. However, when reducing the number of past bins to avoid the bias, one might miss relevant information, and thus significantly underestimate M. Therefore, we use a Bayesian estimator (NSB [2]) with reduced bias and developed a criterion to detect the bias onset that was validated using a realistic model neuron [3] (Fig. 1B). This allows us to incorporate a maximum number of past bins while avoiding estimation bias. \nBy systematically increasing the past time range (i.e. the number of past bins times the bin size), we found that in vivo and in vitro past activity of at least 50ms adds information about the neuron‚Äôs spiking probability (Fig. 1C,D). Conversely, considering less past, as it is commonly done in transfer entropy estimation, leads to considerable underestimation of M. In vitro, M is not only smaller but also becomes negligible in a GLM that additionally incorporates the past population activity (PPA), suggesting that the neuron's past serves only as a readout of the population activity and has no intrinsic memory contributions. In vivo, however, incorporating the PPA hardly decreased M. This indicates an interesting dynamic regime where the single neuron presents non-redundant information about the past, although being subject to inputs in a recurrent network. ",

        "text": "Synchronous neural activity is a typical activity in biological neural networks in-vivo and in-vitro. Spontaneous bursting activity plays an important role in the development of synaptic connections in dissociated cultured neural networks [1, 2]. In the brain, information processing capabilities like memory formation [3] and data coding [4] rely on controlled bursting dynamics. However, some brain disorders, like epilepsy and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, are connected to pathological bursts and many treatment methods comprise stimulation of brain regions to intercept synchronous events [5]. \nWhile it is known that the burst of neural activities originate and terminate in distinct regions in epilepsy [6], it is, however, unclear what properties define the time and region of onset of such activity. In an attempt to investigate these properties, we have developed a computational neural network model that mimics essential properties of cortical networks in vitro, in which such bursting is ubiquitous, and it includes anisotropic connectivity, clustering of somata, and fasciculation of axons. These networks showed activity dynamics that in many respects were similar to cultured neural networks. We analyzed the spatial distribution and mesoscale structure of connectivity in relation to the participation of local subnetworks in different stages of extra- and intraburst activity. Our findings show that bursts usually start from areas with balanced excitation and inhibition or excess inhibition, while they ended in areas receiving excess excitation. The spatial distribution of initiation areas is non-random and associated with recurrent connectivity at network boundaries. These results are compatible with findings in seizure studies that observe an increase of inhibition in burst leading regions [7].",

        "text": "To understand how a neuron or a network responds to a stimulus it is necessary to compare spike trains with each other. This is often done by comparing first order statistics such as the firing rates. However, firing rate can remain the same across conditions even though the temporal structure of spike trains undergoes  a significant change. To understand and quantify this change it is necessary to compare not only firing rates but also all of neural temporal interaction structure. In this work we used the Hallinger and Kullback Leibler distances to quantify spike train differences. We find that small difference in time constants between two spike trains can result in disproportionately large differences in spike space, even for spike trains of the same rate.",

        "text": "A neuron's membrane voltage dynamics are shaped by a finite number of stochastic\nelements: the voltage-gated ion channels. Consequently, neurons are intrinsically\nnoisy ``devices'' and timing of spikes is variable, even if the input is constant [1,2].\n\nSome ion channel types exert a particularly large influence on spike time precision. For example, D-type K$^+$-channels have experimentally been shown to\nincrease spike time precision, and regulation of these channels\ncould either break or maintain synchrony in corresponding neuronal networks\n[3]. Modulation of spike time variability has also been observed by channels such\nas the persistent Na$^+$ and HCN channel [4]. Beyond the contribution of ion channels to conductance fluctuations (i.e., channel noise), however, they can also \ninfluence the (deterministic) susceptibility of spiking dynamics to noise from other sources (either external or from other ion channels).  \n\nWhile many numerical simulation studies have previously analyzed the influence of channel dynamics on spike time precision [5,6],\nan analytical perspective on dynamical systems theory can further deepen our understanding of this relation.\nHere, we hence investigate the impact of channel stochasticity on spike time jitter across\nthree distinct dynamical regimes in the vicinity of a neuron's spike threshold. Based on\nmathematical sensitivity analysis, we quantify how ion channel composion determines the net effect on spike timing from an the interplay between deterministic and stochatic channel dynamics.\n\nWe find that, in a mean-driven regime (i.e., a mean stimulation above threshold), the influence of a specific channel type on spike time jitter is determined by the overlap\nbetween (i) the actual phase-dependent noise strength, and (ii) the\nsusceptibility of spiking to perturbations of that specific ion channel type.\nThe latter is given by the gating phase-response curves (PRCs). For a class 1\nneuron (those with a firing onset via a saddle-node bifurcation), we demonstrate that the magnitude of the gating PRCs can be related\nto the angle between the gating dimension and the eigenvector corresponding to\nthe strongly stable manifold of the saddle-node at firing onset. Consequently, if gating PRCs\nand noise strength align, fluctuations in channel opening can maximally shift\nspike times.\nOverall, we find that the characteristics of ion channel kinetics exerting the largest influence on spike time jitter are tied to the type of firing-onset bifurca",

        "text": "Even in the absence of a particular sensory stimulus or behavioral task, mammalian cortex features complex dynamical behavior on multiple scales. On the single-cell level, neurons spike irregularly with increasing intrinsic time scales along the visual hierarchy [1]. Cortical layers and cell types show heterogeneous average firing rates. On a global scale, cortical areas form clusters with covarying activity, so-called resting-state networks [2]. These dynamics emerge on a substrate of complex connectivity on the level of cell types, layers and areas. With increasing knowledge on cortical structure, it is a growing challenge to integrate this information into a consistent picture of cortical connectivity.  \n\nTo jointly characterize the connectivity and spontaneous dynamics of cortex, we present a spiking multi-scale model of macaque visual cortex connected according to a new connectivity map based on multiple sources. It thus makes the nontrivial step from a population description [3] to a spiking description of this system. Visual cortex serves as an example system on which we develop the necessary tools to simulate spiking networks of this scale with realistic population-level connectivity, enabling analogous models of further cortical regions in future.\n\nThe network connectivity combines data from numerous tracing studies, collected in a new release of the CoCoMac database [4], with a recent quantitative dataset [5] and is refined using dynamical constraints [6]. The model for each area is an adaptation of a microcircuit model of early sensory cortex [7] to the specific laminar structure of the given area.\nSimulations on the JUQUEEN supercomputer show that plausible dynamics emerge from the network, mimicking experimental findings on cortical dynamics on multiple scales, from single-cell spiking properties [1] to the large-scale interaction patterns of cortical areas [2]. Furthermore, cortico-cortical interactions propagate predominantly in the feedback direction, akin to experimental observations during sleep or visual imagery [8]. Our study demonstrates that such multi-scale dynamics can emerge from the connectivity on the level of areas and populations, thereby separating network effects from the influence of cell-type specific intrinsic dynamics. Our working model can easily be extended to other cortical areas, and it provides a substrate on which functional features at the spiking level can be added.",

        "text": "A prominent property of visual cortical neurons is a selective response to specific orientations of a visual stimulus. Contributions to this orientation preference may come from both, recurrent connections as well as external inputs from the early visual pathway through the thalamus. Notably, the earliest scheme to explain orientation selectivity relies solely on a specific wiring scheme of the converging thalamic inputs without any recurrent contribution [1]. To causally test the relative contributions of recurrent vs. feed-forward inputs, one needs in principle the capability to control and potentially randomize specific parts of the wiring diagram in a functioning circuit. Such manipulation in-vivo is inconceivable with current technology. We instead propose to use hybrid synthetic neuronal circuits composed of simulated and living nerve cells, in which key features of the wiring diagram can be manipulated.\n\nIn a proof of concept application, we computed thalamocortical input currents to layer IV of cat for both simulated orientation specific and randomized projections in the early visual pathway. These input currents were then elicited optogenetically in a neuronal network in-vitro by digital phase-only holography [2]. The neurons are derived from the cortices of embryonic rats expressing the light-sensitive ionchannel ChRII. The typical cell density in these cultures is around $50000/\\text{mm}^3$ with $90\\%$ excitatory cells. We monitor neural responses both optically with a redshifted genetically encoded calcium indicator [3] and extracellularly with a multielectrode array.\n\nWe electrically recorded 515 units in 18 experiments. As expected, with orientation selective inputs, the neurons show substantial orientation selectivity. However, after randomizing the input wiring scheme, a significant orientation bias in the neuronal responses remained (mean OSI = 0.10, p<0.001), with the strongest units reaching an orientation selectivity index of OSI=0.61. Our results show that feature selectivity can be an emergent feature of random neuronal circuits. ",

        "text": "The recently released Brian 2 simulator[1] is a fundamental rewrite of the popular Brian simulator[2, 3] for spiking neural networks. The strength of the simulator is that it combines ease of use and flexibility with high simulation performance. Ease of use and flexibility is achieved by a system that allows the user to describe neuronal and synaptic models as well as initial conditions and synaptic connectivity with mathematical notation and a system of explicit physical units[4]. The high simulation performance is achieved by using a code generation approach[5] that transparently generates efficient code in a compiled language like C++ from the user-provided model descriptions. From the user's perspective, Brian 2 is used as a library for the Python programming language, the code generation happens without any user intervention \"behind the scenes\".\n\nThis poster gives a general overview over Brian's features and technology and presents several recent noteworthy improvements, in particular:\n* A new syntax for efficient synapse generation, based on Python's generator syntax;\n* A system to \"snapshot\" the simulation state either to memory or to disk and to \"roll back\" to such a state later;\n* An improved system for specifying and loading neuronal morphologies for multicompartmental simulations that are solved efficiently with optional support of parallel execution on multiple processor cores.\n\nBrian 2 is made available under a free software license and all development takes place in public code repositories[1]. Documentation, tutorials and examples can be found online[6].",

        "text": "Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) play a crucial role in hearing by encoding synaptic input from the inner hair cells into afferent spiking information for the higher stages of the auditory system. If the inner hair cells are degenerated, hearing can be restored with cochlear implants (CIs) that stimulate the ANFs directly with electrical pulses. However, several characteristics of the ANF and the stimulus affect whether and how the ANF responds to a particular stimulation pulse sequence. Such information is vital for optimizing CI processing but can be acquired only by recording single-fiber responses with other mammals or extracting it from compound responses of human listeners. The optimization process could benefit from computational models being able to predict peripheral responses evoked by a given stimulation. To that end, we have developed a phenomenological model for the ANF response to arbitrary pulse shapes and sequences. It is adapted from the stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model by Horne et al. [1], where the ANF is thought to integrate incoming electrical current and to release an action potential if the membrane voltage exceeds a stochastic threshold and if the neuron is not hyperpolarized before being ready to spike.  A stochastic delay is introduced between the threshold crossing and the time of spiking to account for the latency and jitter of the ANF. The model can reproduce neurophysiological data from single pulse stimulations and it can account for inter-pulse interactions in pulse-train stimulation. Specifically, elements modeling the refractory behavior of ANFs have been added and the model has been extended to include two integrator units corresponding roughly to the peripheral and central part of the neuron. Here, we show that our revised model can account for neurophysiological data of the refractoriness phenomenon and that it demonstrates aspects of facilitation and spike-rate adaptation phenomena. ",

        "text": "The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) exerts prominent pro-social effects [3] and hence considered as potential drug for treatmen of psychosocial diseases in human patients [5]. Despite numerous publications focused on pro-social effects of OT, it is still unknown how social interaction affects electrical activity of OT neurons. \n\nRecent development of cell-type specific opto- [4] and pharmacogenetic [2] viral vectors allows us to identify and manipulate OT neurons in freely moving rats. Using these vectors combined with optoelectrode technique [1, 2] we recorded single OT neuron activity in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei in rat hypothalamus during rest, exploration, and social interaction with unfamiliar conspecifics. Simultaneously we monitored animal behavior by an automated video tracking system (Noldus EthoVision¬Æ XT) coupled to recording of ultrasound vocalizations (Avisoft¬Æ Bioacoustics). Our preliminary results show that social interactions induce an increase in firing rate of individual OT neurons which correlates with the distance between interacting rats and their location in the arena. \n\nTo analyze how selective responses of OT neurons can emerge from the network dynamics, we built a computational model to draw prediction on how silencing of specific OT modules changes the OT network output, and thus the social behavior, in response to a given input. These predictions are experimentally tested using genetic tagging of OT neurons combined with pharmacogenetic neuronal silencers to inhibit neuronal activity in specific modules of the OT network and to examine the consequent effects in the various social paradigms.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation of intrinsic properties of OT neurons during social interaction might help to dissect sensory pathways controlling OT neuron activity and opens perspectives for translational studies of human psychosocial diseases.",

        "text": "Dendrite morphology varies greatly between different cell types and is known to influence neuronal function. The Horton-Strahler order or Strahler order (SO) is a centripetal branch ordering system originally developed for the classification and description of river networks [1,2] that has become popular to study the tree-like structures of neuronal dendrites and axons (e.g. [3]). In contrast to the classical centrifugal branch ordering, Strahler order assignments increase from the terminal branches with order 1 towards the root of the tree. When two branches of the same order meet, the order of the parent branch is increased by 1. However, when two branches of differing orders meet, the higher order is passed on [2]. We used this scheme to examine the general properties of SO-sorted branching statistics in reconstructed dendrites and in synthetically generated model dendrites. \nWe find that branch and segment number distributions sorted by SO exhibit a typical exponential decay, a universal feature of binary trees. The distribution of number of segments follows $2^{-k}$ for SO value $k$ and can serve as a measure of how closely a dendrite approaches the structure of a binary tree that is completely filled with nodes on all levels. The distribution of number of branches that connect continuous segments with the same SO values converges to $4^{1-k}$, which is a known asymptotic property for random binary trees [4]. \nFurthermore, dendritic cable length as a function of SO depends on how planar the neuron is. Also, mean branch length and mean segment length distributions seem to be cell type-specific. These SO-sorted branching measures might therefore be useful to categorise dendritic tree structures. Finally, branch diameters correlate faithfully with SO but not with centrifugal branch ordering, indicating a functional importance of SO for dendritic morphology. ",

On the other hand, ensembles of neurons with low intrinsic noise and highly oscillatory activity of the single cells tend to become synchronized by a common external time-dependent signal and respond with precise spike timing. Here, we approach the question of how to capture the rate-response of an ensemble of neurons for which neither precise spike timing nor a linear modulation of the rate is observed.\n\nFirst, we study a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron in response to a weak cosine signal and demonstrate the following weakly nonlinear effects: i) A pronounced nonlinear rate-modulation by cosine signals even for weak signal amplitudes. ii) A change of the mean firing rate by a signal with zero mean. iii) A pronounced nonlinear response to the sum of two signals.\n\nWe proceed with a numerical verification of the weakly nonlinear effects for a more biologically plausible neuron model, the Na-K model by Izhikevich, which hints that the weakly nonlinear response may be a rather general feature of neural oscillators.\n\nFinally, we show that under certain conditions the rate-response of ensembles of neural oscillators with different levels of intrinsic noise can be faithfully described by either a linear rate-modulation, a weakly nonlinear rate-modulation, or by precise spike timing. Consequently, we argue that a weakly nonlinear theory can provide a link between linear rate-coding and coding via precise spike timing.",

        "text": "Optimising neuronal systems for efficient processing and representation of information is a key principle for both understanding and designing neuronal circuits, but recognising that a particular neuronal phenomena reflects an optimisation process is often difficult. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have been suggested to optimally represent spatial location by their spatially periodic firing fields (Burak06b, Fiete08, Mathis12, Mathis12b). However, it remained controversial whether the robustness and efficiency of the grid cell code is the result of careful tuning of the grid parameters (like the grid scale, Wei15, Stemmler15) or the performance of the system is not very sensitive to the actual parameter settings (Mathis12, Mathis12b, Towse14). This might be because there are very few analytical studies exploring the efficiency of realistic grid codes, where, contrary to nested coding (Mathis12b, Wei15), the spatial scale of the different grid modules are on the same order of magnitude.\n\nHere we develop a novel approach to study the efficiency of grid code based on Diophantine approximations widely used in number theory to approximate real numbers with rationals. We demonstrate analytically that in the case of only a few grid cell modules, the performance of the code is extremely sensitive to the choice of the scale parameter of the modules, therefore optimization is required to achieve efficient spatial representations. However, including more modules not only increases the capacity of the coding, but also decreases the sensitivity of the code to the choice of the parameters - mitigating the need for optimization. In fact, local optimization is harmful in this case, since it leads to one of those few local optima that are globally very inefficient. We also show, that in the limit of large number of modules asymptotically optimal efficiency is reached for almost all scale size setting and demonstrate by simulations that this limit is already approached at $\\sim 10$ modules. Thus the scale parameters of the entorhinal grid cell representation is unlikely to be optimised to improve coding efficiency. Our work highlights the importance of studying the basic computational principles underlying a particular form of representation to recognise optimization processes in nervous systems.",

        "text": "Neurons sharing similar features are often selectively connected with a higher probability and should be located in close vicinity in order to save wiring. Selective connectivity has therefore been proposed to be the cause for spatial organization in cortical maps [1]. Interestingly, orientation preference (OP) maps in the visual cortex are found in carnivores and primates [2,3] but not in rodents [4], indicating fundamental differences in selective connectivity [5] that seem unexpected for such homologous systems. Here, we investigate this finding by introducing a novel method to model neural placement that minimizes wiring costs for any given connectivity. Our model shows a transition from an unstructured salt-and-pepper organization to a pinwheel arrangement when increasing the density of neurons even without changing the selectivity of the connections. Increasing neuronal density also switches unstructured maps to layers, retinotopy or ocular dominance columns for the respective selective connectivity corresponding to each arrangement. A difference in neuronal density was indeed found between rodents and primates [6] which could explain the difference in OP maps between these species consistent with our model data. ",

However, to date two contradictory hypotheses prevail: The first proposed an asynchronous irregular (AI) state [1], which minimizes redundancy [2] and promotes fast network responses. The second proposed a critical state [3], which is characterized by long range correlations in space and time, because it optimizes performance in tasks that profit from long reverberation of the network activity in models. Distinguishing between these two states is straight forward when the activity of all neurons is known. However under subsampling [4,5], classic approaches can mistake a network close to critical as AI: We showed that single neurons exhibit exponential inter-spike-interval distributions, and the Fano factor of single neurons is always close to unity.\n\nUsing the framework of branching networks (BN), we derived a novel estimator, which can infer the dynamical state even under strong subsampling, in principle from the activity of a single neuron (Fig. A). In this framework, the dynamical state is characterized by the number $m$ of postsynaptic spikes triggered by one presynaptic spike on average. In contrast to previous estimators [6], the novel estimator is unbiased, i.e. it is invariant under subsampling.\n\nWe applied this novel estimator to spiking activity in monkey prefrontal cortex, cat visual cortex, and rat hippocampus. Consistently, in vivo dynamics is situated in a narrow regime (median $\\hat{m}=0.984$)  between AI ($m=0$) and critical ($m=1$). A model with the same  $m$ as in vivo (in vivo-like BN) could predict both, the bin size dependent spike count cross correlations between neurons (Fig. B) and the avalanche size distributions of the in vivo recordings (Fig. C) . The latter clearly differed from power-laws, which have been used as marker of criticality.\n\nOur results offer a parsimonious solution to the competing hypotheses: activity appeared AI-like, as under subsampling correlations are underestimated. In contrast, coarse measures potentially overestimated correlations, making a network appear critical. Instead, in vivo spiking dynamics reflects a specific regime around m=0.984. This regime may combine the computational benefits of both states by allowing integration of information without the risk of instability or slowing down associated with criticality.",

The emergence of this common design has been explained by an abstract class of mathematical models for neural circuit self-organization([1],[3]). So far no biologically detailed model has been shown to conform with all features of this common design. Recently,[4]made available a biologically mechanistic model which mimics visual pathway and can be trained by natural stimuli. We examine and characterize this biologically mechanistic model in order to understand whether detailed models of Hebbian learning for the formation of nerve cell networks quantitatively match the common design in the visual cortex or not.\n\nOur results show that, when covering a substantial fraction of the period of juvenile plasticity([5]), the statistics of pinwheel layouts including average pinwheel densities generated by the model are time-dependent and typically drop below experimentally observed values.\n\nWe find that, maps in the simulation typically become ordered and crystal-like over time. This process is driven by pinwheel annihilation and creation events. During the time course the ordered and a banded geometry of orientation domain start from the boundary of V1 increasingly dominates the whole simulation area. This indicates that boundary effects strongly influence pinwheel layouts in this model.\n\nWe conclude that common design is highly informative and can be used to assess all the validity of biologically detailed model.

Since their decay time constant ($\\sim 3\\, ms$) is small compared with the membrane time constant of neurons ($\\sim 30\\,ms$), voltage clamp (VC) whole cell recordings are best suited to study their kinetics. Voltage clamp consists of setting the membrane potential to a fixed value and hence recording the corresponding current. This poses two problems: Firstly, as the voltage is set in the patch location and the synaptic input may be received far away from it, there is some spatial distortion (space clamp); secondly, as the voltage is fixed, it is not possible to see how conductance changes interact with synaptic integration.\n\nSynaptic inputs change the overall conductance of the neuron, thus changing the membrane constant. As the time constant rules how fast the cell depolarizes to the target membrane potential, its reduction may enhance integration.  We propose a method to measure this conductance change in current clamp (CC). We patch a neuron and inject a small sinusoidal current while triggering synaptic input at different phases of the sinusoidal wave. At any time point of the the synaptic event we have a set of (I, V, dV/dt) points to fit into a simplified equation of the membrane and thus obtain the instantaneous value of the membrane time constant ($\\tau\\star$).\n\nExperimental patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons show that $\\tau\\star$ variations present faster kinetics than excitatory post synaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded in VC, suggesting that space clamp affects $\\tau\\star$ recorded in CC less than EPSCs recorded in VC as a readout of synaptic conductances. \n\nIn conclusion, $\\tau\\star$ is a measure of excitatory conductance due synaptic input. It is less affected by space clamp than EPSCs and it does not require to have the membrane potential fixed, it may be used to analyze the effect of conductance changes, i.e., passive properties, in synaptic integration.",

        "text": "It has been discovered that cortical neurons can realize fast population encoding[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The underlying biophysical mechanisms however are not well understood. Although it has been shown that reducing action potential onset rapidness can impair encoding bandwidth[5], it is not clear whether onset rapidness and encoding bandwidth are tightly connected with each other. Several biophysical hypotheses have been proposed[6, 7, 8]. One hypothesis states that rapid action potential onset is caused by the separation of the action potential initiation site and the soma[7]. And this separation causes the fast population encoding.  Here we examine this hypothesis with the firing rate linear response function. We found that the initiation site separation hypothesis alone is not sufficient to reproduce the high cutoff frequency observed in cortical neurons[2, 4, 5]. Also, the linear response functions at high frequencies are insensitive to the temporal correlations of the inputs. This disagrees with previous experiments as well[4]. By tuning the slope of the sodium current activation function, we also examine the cooperative gating hypothesis under this multi-compartment framework[6]. The cooperative gating hypothesis proposes that when emitting spikes, sodium channels are more likely to open together. The sodium current activation function is like a step function. When the cooperative gating of the sodium channels is introduced, both discrepancies above are resolved. We further compare the action potential dynamics under these two hypotheses, and propose an explanation for these discrepancies. We examine a simplified model of the multi-compartment model with cooperative gating. With some approximations, we obtain the linear response function for this model analytically. The analytic result indicates that decreasing the  soma size can help to improve the encoding bandwidth, and the encoding bandwidth is insensitive to the separation distance between the soma and the action potential initiation site.  In summary, our study shows that the separation of the action potential initiation site from the soma alone is not sufficient to realize fast population encoding. Adding cooperative gating of the sodium channels to the model can reproduce this property. In the cooperative gating model, the separation of the action potential initiation site from the soma plays a limited role in determining high cutoff frequency.",

        "text": "In clinical studies or neuro-rehabilitation treatment involving patients with special needs, such as children, elderly, or individuals suffering from behavioral or developmental disorders, special care and attention is required when choosing measurement instrumentation [1]. In this regard, electroencephalography (EEG) is often delicate for its invasive looks, long preparation times, and rather complicated handling. We present the development and validation of a prototype for a simple and practical electroencephalography (EEG) device tuned to the special requirements of a clinical study on sensorimotor disabilities. We merged consumer EEG hardware with an unobtrusive headphones design to yield a device which has non-obtrusive looks that is not immediately associated with a clinical examination device. 13 semi-dry EEG channels were embedded in a flexible sheet mounted between the headphone earpieces and covering the majority of sensorimotor areas. In addition, the prototype features one EOG channel optionally attachable e.g. to the patient‚Äôs cheek for online or post-hoc EOG artifact correction. The prototype can be easily adapted to different head-sizes (approx. 50-60 cm diameter) and was validated both on children and adults. Furthermore, preparation times are very short (approx. 5 minutes) and comfortable wearing is provided for up to 30 minutes. Data quality was validated using a standard motor imagery task protocol. Our results indicate that the expected sensorimotor effects (mu- and beta- desynchronization) can successfully be captured [2]. An analysis on signal discriminability suggested that our device would be applicable in sensorimotor brain-computer interface (BCI) applications [3] or neuro-rehabilitation treatment [4]. Both researchers / experimenters as well as probands provided very positive feedback on usability and wearing comfort.",

        "text": "Chip-based arrays, which facilitate parallel stimulation and recording of chemical and electrical cell-network activity, provide high-throughput methods for investigating neuronal communication. For example, we have recently shown that real-time electrochemical detection at microelectrode arrays can be used for monitoring vesicular dopamine release from many individual cells in parallel 1. Yet, to study specific network arrangements in vitro and to establish disease model systems, which mimic neuronal pathways in the brain, functional interfaces have to be combined with methods that can precisely control the layout and polarity of cellular networks. In this respect, microfluidic cell-culture techniques for guiding cell growth in defined patterns have gained increasing attention 2‚Äì4. Here, we report on rapid-prototyping approaches for establishing organized cell culture systems and combining them with functional stimulation and sensor elements. As opposed to classical clean-room fabrication, our approach relies on printing technologies. While being restricted to low-resolution patterning in the range of several micrometers, the flexibility and speed of the fabrication process makes it possible to quickly adapt the sensor and network architectures to arbitrary designs. We show how printed sensor arrays can be used for the detection of action potentials in cell culture systems. We believe that the design flexibility of this technology is interesting for investigating geometry-dependent cell-model systems.\n \nReferences\n(1) \tYakushenko, A.; K√§telh√∂n, E.; Wolfrum, B.

        "text": "Myoelectric prosthetics are devices that substitute and replace lost human limbs for amputees with significant active research efforts. We designed an upper-limb myoelectric prosthetic controlled by surface electromyography signals (sEMG). First, we designed electronic sensor circuits for non-invasive EMG signals recording and acquisition. After preprocessing data, we decomposed EMG signals using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), time and frequency analyses in order to extract relevant information from recording data. After that, we implemented a multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to classify four standard movements (Flexion, extension and prono-supination). Finally, a prototype of the myoelectric prosthetic has been used to demonstrate the capabilities and the performance of the proposed control system. As preliminary study, successful control has been achieved for one test subject. However, the current control system is incapable to adapt itself to various changes such as EMG signals distortion, electrode misplacement and drifts. Moreover, the developed control system requires high power, and provides low controllability and limited degrees of freedom (DoFs). To extend the current system, we aim to develop an advanced controller based on an embedded, small and energy efficient neuromorphic algorithm. Using neuromorphic computing devices expect real-time and low power consumption. We plan to incorporate two biosignals (EMG for control and EEG for error correction) and we will develop adaptive neural decoding algorithms to become robust to changes.\n\nKey words: Myoelectric prosthetic, EMG signals, EEG signals, embedded neuromorphic controller, adaptive neural decoding algorithm\n",

        "text": "Dopamine (DA) plays an important role for reward related learning, motor control and action selection. Consistent with this, the death of DA neurons in Parkinson's disease leads to severe motor and cognitive symptoms.\n\nWhile the single unit activity of DA neurons matches reward prediction error responses, direct measurements of DA concentration in the striatum have indicated a more complex picture of the DA signal. For example, it is unclear how the ramping DA concentration in the striatum during the approach of a goal is connected to spiking of DA neurons. Therefore, the spatio-temporal DA concentration in the striatum does not seem to be a straightforward result of the activity of DA neurons. To better understand how DA cell firing relates to changes of the DA concentration we created a model of the spatio-temporal distribution of the striatal DA caused by different spiking patterns of DA neurons. Our model is based on a restricted diffusion model taking into account that free diffusion of DA in the striatum is hindered by obstacles like neurons and glia cells. To obtain a biological realistic model, we incorporate non-homogeneous DA uptake, DA axonal tree morphologies, detailed DA receptor kinetics, and spike trains based on rat DA cell recordings.\n\nWe find that the resulting DA maps have complex temporal and spatial dynamics that cannot simply be classified as \"high\" or \"low\" average DA concentration. Furthermore, we simulated Parkinson's disease by removing DA-releasing axons. We find, in agreement with experimental studies, that the average DA concentration does not change until a large fraction (>80%) of the DA neurons have died. Importantly, in the model this effect can be explained by the reduced DA re-uptake due to reduced number of axons. Thus our model provides an alternate explanation for the maintenance of DA levels in Parkinson's disease without invoking any compensatory mechanisms. Finally, we generate maps for D1 and D2 receptor activation for healthy and pathological states based on different D1 and D2 receptor affinities.\n\nOverall, our simulations provide a detailed description of how DA cell activity translates into spatio-temporal activation of DA receptors which is an important component for understanding functional contributions of DA to information processing in normal and pathological behavior.",

        "text": "Reversal learning has been extensively studied across species as a task that indexes the ability to flexibly make and reverse deterministic stimulus‚Äìreward associations. Although various brain lesions have been found to affect performance on this task, the behavioral processes affected by these lesions have not yet been determined. This task includes at least two kinds of learning. First, subjects have to learn and reverse stimulus‚Äìreward associations in each block of trials. Second, subjects become more proficient at reversing choice preferences as they experience more reversals. We have developed a Bayesian approach to separately characterize these two learning processes. Reversal of choice behavior within each block is driven by a combination of evidence that a reversal has occurred, and a prior belief in reversals that evolves with experience across blocks. We applied the approach to behavior obtained from 89 macaques, comprising 12 lesion groups and a control group. We found that animals from all of the groups reversed more quickly as they experienced more reversals, and correspondingly they updated their prior beliefs about reversals at the same rate. However, the initial values of the priors that the various groups of animals brought to the task differed significantly, and it was these initial priors that led to the differences in behavior. Thus, by taking a Bayesian approach we find that variability in reversal-learning performance attributable to different neural systems is primarily driven by different prior beliefs about reversals that each group brings to the task.",

        "text": "Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have investigated control processes during task switching. Behavioral findings indicate a cost of switching such that reaction times are higher on switch compared to stay (repeat) trials. Functional MRI studies have suggested that a fronto-parietal network (FPN) is involved in task switching and in cognitive control in general. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) studies have revealed that specific task representations are encoded in the FPN. However, it has remained unclear whether task switching affects the neural representations of tasks in this network. One possibility could be that behavioral switch costs are due to a failure to fully implement a task representation in the FPN on switch trials. Here, we thus used MVPA to investigate task representations during task switching. On each trial participants were cued to perform one of two similar tasks (stimulus-response-mappings), with the task being repeated or switched between successive trials.  MVPA was used to assess encoding of the specific task on a given trial, which revealed task information in the known fronto-parietal network. However, the task-related information in FPN did not differ between switch and repeat trials. Using cross-classification we found that tasks are encoded using a similar spatial topography in switch and repeat trials in FPN. Thus, task representations in FPN are largely switch-independent. We thus found no evidence that neural information about task representations in FPN can explain the known behavioral costs associated with task switching.",

        "text": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that is characterized by recurrent seizures. In around one third of cases, epilepsy is not controlled by drugs, and these patients are potential candidates for surgery. The current paradigm for surgery is to remove as completely as possible the ‚Äúepileptogenic zone‚Äù [1], i.e., the brain tissue responsible for generating seizures. This zone is hypothetical, currently inferred using qualitative analysis of patient data, and assumed to correspond to a localized abnormality. However, epilepsy surgery does not always lead to seizure freedom, with remission after surgery achieved in approximately 60-70% cases, and more than a half of patients no longer seizure-free 10 years after surgery [2]. A confounding factor that may explain these poor success rates is that seizures are now acknowledged to arise in large-scale brain networks, and consequently localized abnormalities are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the development of seizures [3]. However, it remains unclear how different network structures cause emergent seizures, and whether certain network structures would be more or less amenable to a surgical approach. \n\nTo address this, we use mathematical models of seizure generation in brain networks and evaluate the emergent dynamics in different synthetic networks such as random, small-world, scale-free, and rich-club networks. In each case we quantify the contribution of each node to the propensity of the network to seize (ictogenicity) and study how this correlates with node properties and network topology. We find that nodes with highest eigenvector centrality are the most responsible for seizure generation. Also, the ictogenicity of a network depends on its structure, and in particular networks incorporating rich-clubs are more likely to contain highly ictogenic nodes. Finally, we analyze functional networks derived from ECoG recordings from refractory epileptic patients. These were patients who, with few exceptions, received surgery, and accordingly we find the presence of rich-clubs in their functional networks. Thus, we show that this mathematical framework can be applied to clinical data, and may provide valuable aid to presurgical assessment of epileptic patients. ",

        "text": "The basal ganglia are considered essential for action selection and reinforcement learning. In combination with its connections from and to cortex and thalamus, the basal ganglia form a distributed and intricately connected network that is difficult to fully capture with electrophysiological recordings. Computational modelling could therefore be highly valuable in studying the functional roles of the direct, indirect and hyper-direct pathways. Here, we take the approach of dynamic causal modelling (DCM) where each structure in the network is represented as a neural mass and model parameters are estimated from EEG/MEG or LFP recordings using Bayesian inversion. Neural dynamics are described with second order convolution based equations. To complement the existing suite of DCMs in SPM, we implemented a separate basal ganglia ‚Äònode‚Äô (consisting of striatum, GPe, STN, GPi, and thalamus) [1,2] that can be combined with the conventional cortical network models in DCM. We used the combined cortical-basal ganglia model to estimate power and cross-spectral densities obtained from simultaneously recorded magneto-encephalography (from cortex) and local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus in 11 Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients who received deep brain stimulation treatment. Beta oscillations were more pronounced in the OFF compared to ON dopaminergic medication states. The model provides support for both the striatal filtering hypothesis and recurrent connections between GPe and STN as generator sites for beta oscillations.",

        "text": "Reinforcement learning is an adaptive process where previous experience is utilized to improve the outcomes of future choices. This process involves the representation and processing of prediction errors which, in the brain, is closely linked to the dopaminergic system. In humans, modifications of the dopaminergic system are evident in neuro-degenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson's and Huntington's disease), addiction or psychiatric disorders, and go along with alternated performance in reinforcement learning tasks in patients compared to healthy controls.\n\nIn obesity research, empirical studies suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship of dopamine-type2-receptor binding potential (BP) and measures of obesity, implying a higher BP for  overweight/mild obesity and a lower BP for severe obesity. In addition, behavioral and neuroimaging studies show differences between lean and obese individuals in reinforcement learning tasks.\n\nIn the present work, we develop forward models to investigate how different manipulations of the dopaminergic system draw distinct signaling signatures in target brain areas, such as the striatum. Manipulations of dopamine transmission are implemented in a model of basal ganglia functioning, a biologically plausible learning machine that is capable of solving reinforcement learning tasks based on prediction error processing. We compare model behavior to experimental data from individuals with obesity, in order to assess how much of the observed behavioral alterations are characterized by dopamine transmission-induced deficits in prediction error processing.

        "text": "Learning to adapt behavior in order to optimize positive while avoiding negative feedback is essential for survival. To this end, humans and animals are constantly seeking to predict the causal structure of their environment and the consequences of their actions. However, inferring the optimal course of action may not always be immediately tractable and it has been observed that in uncertain situations animals may rely on ecologically sensible behavioral strategies such as win-stay, lose-shift, or alternate, with these behaviors also being more readily acquired depending on the environmental context.\nHere, we investigate learning behavior on a two-choice operant cue discrimination task in two groups of mice, genetically modified mice associated with a severe learning deficit, i.e. a selective knockout of the $\\textit{CACNA1C}$ gene coding for the $Ca_{v}1.2$ subunit of the L-type high-voltage dependent calcium channels ($Ca_{v}1.2^{NesCre}$), and matched controls $Ca_{v}1.2^{fl/fl}$. L-type calcium channels are crucial for synaptic plasticity which underlies instrumental learning, and less functional variants of $\\textit{CACNA1C}$ have been associated with psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and autism, rendering it an important target for understanding learning mechanisms in psychiatric conditions. By studying the detailed pattern of behavioral responses and rewards received across the learning process, combined with analyses based on behavioral (reinforcement) learning models, we show that $Ca_{v}1.2^{NesCre}$ mice specifically fail to learn the operant rule, while learning in the form of behavioral adaptation of more elementary strategies such as win-stay and lose-shift remains intact.

        "text": "Optimal synaptic plasticity rules are typically described as gradient rules. In reinforcement learning, optimal plasticity follows the reward gradient [Williams, 1992], in supervised learning, it follows the negative error gradient. Various parameters can be adapted within a synapse such as the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential at the sub-synaptic site, the postsynaptic receptor density, or e.g. the number of presynaptic release sites. While changing these parameters in the direction of their local gradient, the synaptic contribution to the somatic potential also changes. These somatic potential contributions eventually determine the firing behavior, and one may directly derive the gradient rule for these postsynaptic potentials (PSP) produced by the individual synapses. For the theory to be consistent, it should not matter whether the optimal PSP changes originate in an optimal change of the number of presynaptic release sites, the postsynaptic receptor densities, or the local potential amplitudes. Yet, the local gradients induce different PSP changes, and hence the theory lacks consistency. To resolve the issue, the standard `Euclidean' gradient calculations need to be replaced by the natural gradient (Amari, 1998). \n\nWe derive the natural gradient learning rule for spiking neurons. Instead of the Euclidean metric, this rule calculates the gradient with respect to a local metric on the synaptic weight space that is given intrinsically by the neuron's input-output distribution. As compared to the Euclidean gradient, the natural gradient shows a scaling by the total synaptic strength on the dendritic tree, and an additional hetero-synaptic term. In addition, it is coordinate invariant and hence independent of which specific synaptic parameters are adapted during plasticity.",

        "text": "Neuronal networks in the brain display a wide variety of plasticity mechanisms, some of which have been interpreted as homeostatic regulators of neural activity. This includes synaptic mechanisms such as activity-dependent scaling and GABAergic plasticity, as well as plasticity of glutamatergic synapses onto inhibitory interneurons [1]. While the first two have been adopted in computational models [2,3], the last has attracted less attention.\n\nHere, we investigate how excitatory synapses onto interneurons can function as a homeostatic regulator of excitatory activity. To this end, we simulate locally connected recurrent networks with a variety of excitatory-to-inhibitory plasticity rules, all of which have a fixed point where the presynaptic rate for each cell equals a homeostatic target.\n\nWe show that for a Hebbian rule (analogous to [3]), excitatory cells compete to control inhibition, driving most of the network into a quiescent state. The competition arises from the fanout in recurrent connectivity that produces de-localized inhibition when local inhibition is asked for. This problem is only overcome when a) the post-synaptic rate dependence in the rule is removed, b) the presynaptic rate is replaced by a local population average, and c) the region over which it is averaged is sufficiently large compared to the connectivity range. Such a rule is conceptualized as plasticity mediated by a diffusing agent released by active excitatory cells. The diffusion-mediated rule successfully controls the local population rate, while leaving local variability uncompensated, in contrast to homeostatic plasticity on GABAergic synapses which compensates each excitatory cell in a fine-grained manner [3].\n\nThese results predict that manipulating the activity of small groups of principal cells should produce homeostatic changes to glutamatergic synapses onto inhibitory interneurons in neighbouring principle cells. Furthermore, any plasticity observed at these synapses that is not mediated by a diffusive agent is unlikely to homeostatically regulate excitatory firing rates.",

        "text": "We first assess the problem of detecting a multi-neuron spike sequence with duration L with a single leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron equipped with instantaneous synapses. To do so, several strategies are possible: Strategy #n consists in connecting the neuron to all afferents that emit at least n spike(s) during a certain time window Œît‚â§L of the sequence (Fig. 1a shows Strategy 1; the selected afferents emit red spikes). We want to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the resulting detector, defined as SNR = (E(Vmax)-E(Vnoise))/œÉ(Vnoise) where E(Vmax) is the expected maximal potential reached during the sequence (ignoring the threshold), and E(Vnoise) is the expected potential elsewhere (Fig. 1b). Assuming a Poisson process with rate f for all afferents, both inside and outside the sequence, we could compute the SNR analytically. E.g. for Strategy 1, $$SNR = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\tau N f}{1-e^{- f \\Delta t }}} e^{-f \\Delta t } (1-e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau}),$$where œÑ is the membrane time constant and N is the number of afferents. It turns out that Strategy 1 is usually the best for f and œÑ in the biological range (Fig. 1c, solid lines), and that in that case the optimal Œît is only slightly greater than œÑ (Fig. 1d), even if the sequence is much longer. Shorter œÑ are also better (but a small jitter would then impair recognition, a problem that we do not address here).\nNext, using simulations, we investigated if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) could drive the LIF towards this optimum. We used additive all-to-all-spike STDP[1], with homeostasis[2]. The afferents fired continuously according to a Poisson process. From time to time, an arbitrary sequence, initially generated with the same Poisson process, was repeated (frozen noise), like in ref. [3]. Starting from random values, the weights rapidly ended up binarized. Reinforced synapses corresponded to the afferents that emitted at least one spike during a certain time window of the sequence (i.e. Strategy 1), whose duration, using certain STDP parameters, could indeed roughly match the optimal Œît.\nTaken together, these results may explain how we can learn repeating visual[4] or auditory[5] sequences. Long sequences could be recognized thanks to coincidence detectors working at a much shorter timescale. This is consistent with the fact that recognition is still possible if a sound sequence is compressed of played backward[5], or scrambled using 10-ms bins[6].\n",

        "text": "Understanding the structure and dynamics of cortical connectivity is vital to understanding cortical function. Experimental data strongly suggest that local recurrent connectivity in the cortex is significantly non-random, exhibiting, for example, above-chance bidirectionality and an overrepresentation of certain triangular motifs (Song et al. 2005). Additional evidence suggests particular patterns of synaptic turnover dynamics, including a heavy-tailed distribution of synaptic efficacies, a tendency for stronger synapses to be more stable over time, and a power law distribution of synaptic lifetimes (Song et al. 2005, Yasumatsu et al. 2008, Loewenstein et al. 2015). Understanding how such features simultaneously arise would provide valuable insights into the development and function of the cortex. A recently developed spiking, point-neuron-based, structurally and synaptically plastic model has been demonstrated to reproduce all of these features at once (Miner and Triesch 2016). In this poster, we focus on the long-tailed, seemingly power-law distribution of synaptic lifetimes. This was first predicted in the precursor work to this model (Zheng et al. 2013), and was experimentally observed for the first time shortly before the publication of the most recent model variant (Loewenstein et al. 2015, Miner and Triesch 2016). Using this model, we examine what factors may contribute to the slope of the power law distribution. In particular, we note that said slope depends primarily on the effective structural pruning rate, which depends primarily on the effective balance between potentiation and depression in the network, and is independent of various other network factors, such as the structural growth rate and the network size. We investigate other network features and parameters as well and observe their effect, and speculate on the theoretical origins of this phenomenon.",

In turn, this\nallows us to explore the internal\ndynamics of learning the synaptic weights from place cells projecting to\ndeeper layers of the MEC, and the subsequent formation of the\ncharacteristic hexagonal patterns. We show that the weight dynamics follows a structure formation mechanism similar to\nthe Swift-Hohenberg class of spatial patterns comprising stripe or grid like patterns depending on the parameter regime.\n",

        "text": "In the mammalian brain, spatial maps of the environment are thought to be represented by place cells, representing locations in the environment by one or few firing fields, and grid cells, which tesselate the environment with firing fields arranged in a periodic hexagonal pattern. In natural environments, the spatial map of a grid cell may be anchored to different features of the environment but the mechanisms for generating transitions between differentially anchored spatial maps have not yet been established. To search for these mechanisms, we trained rats in two rectangular compartments A and B (each 1x2m) separated by a wall while recording the activity of grid cells. After training, each grid cell displayed two distinct grid maps, one for each environment. These two patterns, although similar in scale, rarely formed a continuous hexagonal pattern in the full 2x2m environment, but had a discontinuity where the partition wall was located. Next, we removed the partition wall and allowed the rat to explore the merged open square box (2x2m). Exploration in the large environment was not accompanied by de novo grid formation. Instead, the original grid patterns of the rectangular boxes were largely retained, but with decreasing similarity along an axis from the outer walls towards the centre. Centrally in the box, where A and B environments merged, individual grid fields changed location, resulting in increased local spatial periodicity and the creation of local continuity between the two original maps. The grid pattern was rarely a simple extension of the A map or the B map. The reorganization of the grid maps was expressed already during the first exposure to the merged environment, suggesting that it takes place on a fast time scale. Taken together, the data suggest that when environments are merged, differentially anchored grid maps fuse very rapidly, with reorganization of the grid field locations in the centre, in a direction that causes local periodicity to be established throughout the environment.

Here, we applied standard visual-working-memory (vWM) tasks with novel hierarchical stimuli (a global ellipse composed of local line orientations) to probe the structure of vWM under varying task demands. Observers were required to remember a set of hierarchically oriented ellipses over a short retention interval. In Experiment 1, observers detected whether an orientation change (large or small) occurred either at an item‚Äôs global or local object level. Next in Experiment 2, observers reproduced a probed item's global or local orientation. We observed an influence of task demands on the global/local structure of vWM representations ‚Äì global precedence was reduced with small, relatively to large changes. When precision is further emphasized by task demands (reproduction of the exact global or local orientation), we observed a reversal of global precedence into local-precedence, suggesting that a local bias can occur when detailed information is to be retained. These results indicate that the structure of vWM is under voluntary control and can be adjusted for varying task demands, thus, challenging accounts that assume fixed representations in vWM.",

        "text": "We investigated the structural development of superficial-layers of medial entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum in rats. The grid-layout and cholinergic innervation of calbindin-positive pyramidal cells in layer 2 emerged around birth while reelin-positive stellate cells were scattered throughout development. Layer 3 and parasubiculum neurons had a transient calbindin-expression, which declined with age. Early postnatally, layer 2 pyramidal but not stellate cells co-localized with doublecortin ‚Äì a marker of immature neurons. This suggested delayed functional maturation of pyramidal cells compared to stellate cells and mirrored the dichotomy of functional maturation of grid and border cells respectively. Three observations indicated a dorsal to ventral maturation of entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum: (i) calbindin-expression in layer-3 neurons decreased progressively from dorsal to ventral, (ii) doublecortin in layer-2 calbindin-positive patches disappeared dorsally before ventrally, and (iii) wolframin expression emerged earlier in dorsal than ventral parasubiculum. The early appearance of calbindin pyramidal grid organization in layer 2 indicates that this pattern is instructed by genetic information rather than experience. Superficial layer microcircuits mature earlier in dorsal entorhinal cortex, where smaller spatial scales are represented while microcircuits in the ventral entorhinal cortex ‚Äì representing larger spatial-scales ‚Äì mature later around the onset of spatial exploratory behavior.",

        "text": "The action potentials of neurons in the hippocampal formation gradually shift their firing phases from late to early with respect to the LFP's theta oscillation (O'Keefe and Recce, 1993). This phenomenon is called 'phase precession'. It was previously hypothesized that phase precession can allow the temporal compression of behavioral sequences, down to the time scale of the induction of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (Skaggs et al., 1996). This idea works well if different cells - that represent different behavioral events - show similar parameters of phase precession. However, the parameters found in experimental data vary over a wide range. From cell-type specific differences (Reifenstein et al., 2016, Ebbesen et al., 2016) to single-trial differences for a given cell (e.g. Reifenstein et al., 2014). It is currently unclear what effect the variability in phase-precession parameters has on the temporal-compression scenario. \nSimulating multiple phase-precessing cells, we systematically vary the different phase-precession parameters of those cells and measure whether the sequence of events is correctly compressed. We find multiple regions of parameter combinations for correct compression. We compare these parameter combinations to experimentally obtained values and investigate how the single-trial variability of individual cells influences sequence learning in the temporal-compression framework. \nTaken together, we quantitatively test the temporal-compression hypothesis and evaluate its robustness to variability of the underlying single-cell phase precession. Therefore, our results have wide implications for the understanding and interpretation of the phase-precession phenomenon.",

        "text": "One of the functional consequences of short-term synaptic depression in neuronal transmission is the modulation of the synaptic information transfer rate [1-4]. To quantify the effect of synaptic depression on the information rate, we model a release site by a binary asymmetric channel (BAC) with a memory of length $L$ (Fig. 1A). The BAC model distinguishes between spike-evoked and spontaneous releases, both of which depend on the history of the site‚Äôs activity: the release probabilities depress whenever a vesicle is released and recover back during quiescent intervals. We model the state transitions of the release site by a Markov chain with $2^L$ states (Fig. 1B) and investigate the information conveyed by the release site about Poisson inputs. We prove that the mutual information rate of the release site, $R_D$, is equal to the statistical average over the information rates of its constituent states. If $R_j$ and $\\pi_j$ represent the mutual information rate and the stationary probability of the state $j$, then \n$$R_D= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} R_j \\pi_j.$$\nOnly short-term depression, but not short-term facilitation, leads to such a linear summation of information rates [5]. \nIn addition, we consider the energy cost of information transfer and calculate the energy-normalized information rate by dividing the mutual information rate by the amount of energy consumed per vesicle release. We show that the optimal energy-normalized information rate occurs at lower spike rate than for the mutual information rate (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the input spike rate that elicits the maximum energy-normalized information rate is robust to the variations of depression level. Therefore, regardless of how strongly synaptic transmission depresses in different neurons, all neurons should receive nearly the same rate of input spikes. \nIn assessing the impact of depression on the information efficacy of the release site, we demonstrate that the relative level of depression for spontaneous and spike-evoked release plays a crucial role. Specifically, depression can enhance the information rate at a release site if vesicle release depresses subsequent spontaneous releases more strongly than spike-evoked releases.",

        "text": "Models of synaptic plasticity typically follow either a top-down approach, where the optimization of some mathematical function leads to a normative weight update, or a bottom-up approach, where experimental findings suggest biophysical parameters that influence learning. Here we try to bring these two approaches together by studying a model suggested by Senn and Urbanczik, where, in a two-compartment model neuron, synaptic plasticity in the dendrite serves to minimize a dendritic prediction error of somatic spiking. While the learning rule minimizes a specific cost function, i.e. is constructed in a top-down manner, we show that a version of the model suitably adjusted for more biological plausibility, manages to reproduce many characteristics observed in spike-timing dependent plasticity experiments. Among these are frequency dependence and the influence of the distance of the synapse to the soma. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the specific learning paradigm the learning rule implements depends on the wiring of the local circuit. Thus, dependent on the local connections, dendritic prediction errors can implement supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning.",

        "text": "Individuals often learn by trial and error to predict reward from relevant cues. For adaptive behavior, the rules connecting actions with their consequences need to be updated whenever reward contingencies change. Rule switching and cognitive flexibility is impaired in major neuropsychiatric disorders. Both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the neuromodulator dopamine (DA) have repeatedly been implicated in behavioral flexibility but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. On the one hand, contemporary learning theories posit that reward prediction errors are passed on to mPFC via DAergic projections (reward prediction error theory). On the other hand, prefrontal levels of DA appear to stabilize or weaken attractor states, and impede or facilitate transitions between them, thereby decreasing or enhancing cognitive shifting and flexibility (dual-state theory).\n\nThe present study employs DAergic pharmacological manipulations and mPFC single-unit recordings during two versions of an operant rule switching paradigm (deterministic and probabilistic extradimensional set shift) to understand mechanisms controlling behavioral flexibility in rats. More specifically, we use a novel method for change point detection and ideal Bayesian learner models to determine how different doses of systemic amphetamine regulate flexibility at the behavioral level and test whether these effects are better captured by predictions of the reward prediction error theory or the dual-state theory. In addition, the prefrontal contribution to behavioral flexibility is examined using model-based analyses of mPFC single-unit recordings. Preliminary data show that mPFC single-unit time series mirror abrupt changes found at the behavioral level and provide evidence with respect to the computational significance of sudden neural transitions.",

        "text": "Neurons in the hippocampal formation exhibit a variety of spatially tuned firing patterns. The mechanisms by which these different patterns emerge are not fully resolved, although competing computational models exist for several of them. Strikingly, many spatially tuned cells display invariances along other spatial dimensions. The tuning of ‚Äúclassical‚Äù place cells and grid cells is invariant to head direction and that of head direction cells invariant to location. Using a computational model, we suggest that all of the observed firing patterns emerge from the same underlying mechanism that can generate both the observed spatial selectivities as well as invariances along other dimensions.\nThe model consists of a feedforward network with a single output neuron. Its essential ingredients are i) spatially modulated excitatory and inhibitory inputs [e.g., 1] and ii) interacting excitatory and inhibitory Hebbian plasticity. The inhibitory plasticity homeostatically controls the output firing rate by balancing excitation and inhibition [2]. We show in simulations and by a mathematical analysis that, depending on the relative spatial autocorrelation length of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs, the output neuron rapidly develops a single place field, a periodic arrangement of firing fields -- akin to grid cells or band cell [3] -- or a spatial invariance. For inputs with combined spatial and head direction tuning, the same mechanism leads to output firing patterns reminiscent of head direction cells, ‚Äúclassical‚Äô grid cells (without head direction tuning) and conjunctive cells (neurons that fire like grid cells in space but only at a particular head direction). Which activity pattern emerges is determined by the spatial correlation structure of the inputs.\nA linear stability analysis of the homogeneous steady state accurately predicts the spatial periodicity obtained from simulations. In contrast to attractor models [4], our model predicts that the spatial scale of grid cells should be robust to global modifications in inhibitory synaptic strength.\nOur model transfers the robust pattern formation of attractor models [e.g., 5] from the neural to the spatial domain, and increases the speed of self-organization of plasticity-based mechanisms [6] to time scales on which the spatial tuning of neurons is typically measured.",

        "text": "Dendritic inhibition influences forward- and backward signaling in dendrites. By selectively blocking backpropagating action potentials in pyramidal neurons [1], inhibitory interneurons can act as switches for excitatory synaptic plasticity and the so-called BAC firing mode [2,3]. However, such a modulation of backward signaling can interfere with the forward flow from dendritic synapses to the soma. To preserve information processing and integration of neuronal inputs, inhibition has to be precisely timed to not hinder the excitatory postsynaptic potential and hence the initiation of the postsynaptic action potential. Here, we propose that spike-timing dependent plasticity of inhibitory synapses in feedforward inhibitory circuits can achieve the required timing of inhibition by selecting appropriately-timed inhibitory synapses. Based on physiologically-constrained multi-compartmental neuron modeling, we first demonstrate the essential properties of an appropriate learning rule and then show that a simple spike-timing dependent rule with anti-Hebbian shape (similar to those observed experimentally) can also establish the appropriate timing of inhibition. We find that the proposed learning mechanism can terminate itself, because the learning process preferentially recruits those inhibitory inputs that eliminate the plasticity rule's own coincidence signal, i.e. the backpropagating action potential. Importantly, the established control of backward signals can be reversed by disinhibition, i.e. removal of dendritic inhibition from principal neurons via another interneuron. Taken together, the proposed learning rule could be an essential ingredient of disinhibitory circuits that provide dynamical switches of plasticity and firing modes for principal neurons (for a review on disinhibitory circuits see [4]).",

        "text": "An important question in working memory is how objects with multiple features are retained. While some suggest an object-based representation with all features bound together; others argue for separate stores for different feature dimensions. A third alternative is the mixture of the object-based model and the feature-based model.\nTo reconcile this controversy, we study binding of different visual features in a working memory experiment. We contrast the binding task with the unbound task, in which different feature domain are memorized separately, regardless of their pairing during presentation. In addition the recall of single features is also tested as a baseline. We also investigate varying numbers of recalled items and varying change magnitude of features. Assuming a feature-based model, capacity estimates for bound and unbound conditions should be equal. Under the assumption of an object-based model binding features together should give an advantage allowing subjects to retain more in bound condition.\nFurthermore, We use a fixed-capacity model to estimate subjects‚Äô capacity in different tasks. We also employ a variable precision model to fit our data, in order to understand how the precision of recall changes between bound and unbound task.\n",

However, statistical methods that take full advantage of the great differences in multi-modal statistics and their intricate dependencies are currently lacking.\nWe developed a framework based on vine copulas [3, 4] with mixed margins to model multivariate data that are partly discrete such as neural spike counts and partly continuous such as local field potentials. The vine copula approach allowed us to derive efficient methods for likelihood calculation, inference and sampling with quadratic complexity in the number of modeled elements. We combined these methods by means of Monte-Carlo integration to obtain unbiased estimates of entropy and mutual information. To test our methods, we generated artificial data from parametric multivariate models. We also generated artificial spike counts and local field potentials from biologically realistic network models using the VERTEX simulator [5].\nWe applied our methods to these data and show that our new approach provides a model fit that is significantly better than that of corresponding independent models. Moreover, we demonstrate that mutual information estimates of fully continuous and mixed independent models can strongly differ from our proposed model which is faithful to the statistics of the margins and their dependencies.\nOur framework presents the prospect of an improved analysis of neural data recorded simultaneously at different scales and from different modalities. Our models can also be used to construct Bayes-optimal decoders in brain-machine interfaces that benefit from concurrent recordings of various modalities.",

        "text": "Cell assemblies [1] exhibiting neuronal interactions at the millisecond time scale were suggested as building blocks of information processing in the brain [2,3]. Significant patterns of synchronous spikes in electrophysiological recordings are considered as a signature of an active assembly. We recently developed a statistical method - the Spike Pattern Detection and Evaluation (SPADE) analysis [4] - to detect synchronous spike patterns in massively parallel spike data (MPST) on the order of 100 or more neurons. The method deals with a) the combinatorial explosion of the number of patterns to consider by employing a variant of the frequent item set mining technique [5, 6], and with b) the challenge of statistically assessing these patterns due to the multiple testing problem by using Monte-Carlo techniques.\n\nWe applied the SPADE analysis to electrophysiological data recorded from the motor cortex of two monkeys while they executed a delayed reach-to-grasp task. Monkeys were trained to reach and grasp, pull and hold an object by using either a side grip or a precision grip and with high or low force. To allow the monkey to prepare the upcoming movement, the animal is instructed about the grip type at the beginning of a delay period of 1s preceding the GO signal. MPST were recorded by using a 100-electrode Utah array chronically implanted at the MI/PMd border [7]. We hypothesized that different classes of spike patterns occur depending on the behavioral conditions and periods in the trial. To investigate this, we analyzed and compared data from the same set of neurons recorded during the 4 different behavioral conditions (combinations of object load and grip type), and during 6 time epochs of different stages of the task protocol.\n\nWe found [8] a variety of significant patterns in specific time epochs and behavioral conditions in both monkeys. We then analyzed the spatial organization of these patterns on the recording array with respect to its cortical location, and found that pairs of neurons involved in synchronous patterns were preferentially aligned along the medio-lateral orientation. We also assessed the specificity of the neuronal composition of patterns to different behavioral contexts and found a strong specificity to the grip type and the specfic behavioral epoch. These findings provide evidence for the existence of higher-order spike patterns occurring in relation to behavior.",

        "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular method to record voltage fluctuations on the surface of the brain. EEG is often used to assess brain dysfunction like epileptic seizures in clinical contexts, but the biophysical origins of the EEG signal are still poorly understood. Therefore only very few generative models (see e.g. [1]) of EEG exist. Here we introduce Conditional Probability Neural Networks (CPNN) as a new means of modeling EEG and similar highly variable neurophysiological data. We train the CPNN to predict EEG time series recorded from epileptic dogs [2] and demonstrate that the trained CPNN outperforms standard time series models, such as the autoregressive process or multilayer perceptron regression in generating  signals that match the power spectrum and other statistics of the recorded EEG.\nBy our adapted and extended method, which was initially developed to analyze particle physics experiments [3], a neural network is trained to represent the conditional probability density function of the future values of a stochastic process, given a set of samples from its past. Once the CPNN is trained it can be used as a generative model if predicted samples are presented as inputs to the CPNN iteratively. Such a model may then be used for forecasting and classification of time-series [4,5], in order to analyze brain dysfunctions like epileptic seizures or other neurological events.\nIn contrast to common machine learning approaches which learn to predict the most likely future value of a time series from samples of its past, the CPNN provides an estimate of the entire conditional probability density function (or posterior distribution), and thus has an intrinsic representation of the process' stochasticity. This aspect might be crucial for modeling highly variable neurophysiological time series such as EEG.",

        "text": "Introduction: Recently, deep learning approaches (in particular convolutional networks) have been extremely successful in solving supervised learning problems such as pattern recognition. Here, we use convolutional networks for classification of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). \nMethods: A pre-trained convolutional neural network (namely the Caffe reference net provided by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center) was applied on two-dimensional MRI slices of (1) 50 AD patients and 49 elderly controls and (2) 41 MS patients and 26 healthy controls. Features from Ô¨Åve convolutional layers (conv1-conv5), one pooling layer (pool5) and three fully-connected layers (fc6-fc8) were extracted (Figure a, dimensions of layers: conv1: 290400, conv2: 186624, conv3: 64896, conv4: 64896, conv5: 43264, pool5: 16896, fc6: 4096, fc7: 4096, fc8: 1000. ). To assess the clinical relevance of different network layers, layer-specific features were fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM) and then used for classification between the clinical groups. Results were cross-validated for each layer. \nResults: Classification accuracies are depicted in Figure (b,c). Notably, the classification accuracies do not only vary between the different clinical groups, but also across the different network layers. For the classiÔ¨Åcation of MS patients, low-level features extracted from the Ô¨Årst layers (presumably corresponding to lesion borders) were in particular important. For AD classification, high accuracies have been additionally found for fully-connected layers. Importantly, the classiÔ¨Åcation accuracies of all layers were higher than for hippocampal volume, one of the key biomarkers of AD. \nDiscussion: These Ô¨Årst very promising results show the great potential that deep learning approaches might have for neuroimaging-based disease decoding. Whereas previous disease decoding approaches mostly relied on the expert-based extraction of features in combination with standard classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms and thus strongly depend on the choice of data representation, convolutional networks are capable of learning hierarchical information directly from raw imaging data. By this, they have a great potential for Ô¨Ånding unexpected and latent data characteristics and might perform as a real ‚Äúsecond reader‚Äù. \n",

A range of different physiological phenomena, from precisely synchronized spiking to broadly simultaneous rate increases, has been subsumed under this term. Yet progress in this area is hampered by the lack of statistical tools that would enable to extract assemblies with arbitrary constellations of time lags, and at multiple temporal scales, partly due to the severe computational burden. Here we present such a unifying methodological and conceptual framework which detects assembly structure at many different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. Applying this methodology to multiple single unit recordings from various cortical areas, we find that there is no universal cortical coding scheme, but that assembly structure and precision significantly depends on brain area recorded and ongoing task demands.\n\n",

        "text": "Dynamical Causal Modeling (DCM) is a promising method to investigate the effective connectivity among brain regions. It uses a Bayesian framework to deduce the hidden neuronal states from the time series of observed data measured by neuroimaging tools such as fMRI and provides posterior estimates of intrinsic synaptic coupling strengths among neuronal populations and also the inputs that modulate those couplings besides the extrinsic inputs on the neuronal states [1]. \nHere we have generalized the routinely used bilinear equation in DCM to the Wilson-Cowan type equations [2], which describes the evolution of excitatory and inhibitory activity in a population of neurons. This opens to possibility to use the results from the macroscopic model (e.g. the model fitted to the fMRI data) to constrain parameters of a detailed network model of a single brain region [3]. In the Wilson-Cowan model, one can interpret the sigmoid transfer function as an averaged f-I curve of many neurons in a single region. \nWe used fMRI data that was measured by our group from 20 participants while they were imitating emotional faces, which revealed the activation of brain regions involved in the mirror neuron system [4], namely the Brodmann Area 44 (BA44), the Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and the Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL) for the right hemisphere. The global connectivity pattern between the regions was determined by the DCM. The network structure of our best model consists of one driving input into STS and feed-forward connections from STS to IPL, from IPL to BA44, and back to STS from BA44.  These feed-forward connections are also modulated by imitation as a contextual input. Bayesian Model Comparison showed that the Wilson-Cowan based models have greater evidence than the original bilinear equation models, both for single state and two-state DCM. Thus, we have shown that DCM with a more complex neuronal model work better than a simple linear model, allowing us to make predictions about the local circuits. ",

        "text": "For many clinical applications as well as in basic research, inference of brain connectivity is of great importance. We are proposing and using a method to estimate effective connectivity from measured fast BOLD-fMRI signals. Among other things, we are looking for causal relations among nodes that is reflected in the non-invasively recorded activity of the whole brain.\nWe assume a linear interaction model, where a non-symmetric matrix of interaction kernels describes the directed influence exerted by nodes onto each other.\nOur method uses only the information contained in the symmetric covariance matrix of the measured activity. This overcomes the problem of the relatively low temporal resolution inherent in fMRI data. For the inference of the direction of connections our method relies on the presence of so called \"collider\" structures in the network. These produce specific entries in the inverse covariance matrix of the measured activity [1,2].\nAs there are many network topologies that induce the same covariance structure, a disambiguation of the underlying causal structure is performed via L1 minimization which is known to prefer sparse solutions under certain conditions [3-5].\nWe applied this method on several data sets of high temporal resolution resting-state fMRI signals and compared the resulting estimates of effective connectivity across hemispheres and across individuals. As we have no access to the ground truth, we also compared the resulting networks with structural connectivity derived by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) [6].",

        "text": "Attention is a cognitive mechanism modulating receptive fields by changing the height of their response as well as their overall shape. For example, it has been shown that attention has variable effects on the receptive fields of neurons in area MT [1,2]. We therefore designed a neuro-computational model mimicking the electrophysiologically measured changes of responses in these neurons in the macaque brain. We show that a previous quantitative model [3] can be derived as a special case of our more general model but also that it has been simplified too much.\nThe receptive fields of our model are constructed by elongated two-dimensional Gaussian curves. Attention is implemented in the model MT-layer with center-symmetric Gaussian shape. We modeled the influence of the target stimulus (random dot pattern, moving in the preferred direction of the neuron) as well as two other distractor stimuli moving in the anti-preferred direction of the measured cell which were presented in the receptive field. Finally, the concept of divisive self-inhibition has been included in the model. The final model describes effects of attentional inhibition and excitation as well as receptive field size changes such as shift, shrinkage, and expansion. For each of the model variants we describe a goodness-of-fit measure which enables us to perform quantitative comparisons among different models.\nComparing our divisive-inhibition model to the previous Gaussian model of attention [3], we show that the simplifications of the Gaussian model result in a loss of several properties, and thereby fail to explain all attentional effects that could be ascertained in the data. Those effects include perception of unattended objects and split attention. We conclude, that an attentional model which explicitly models the influences of distractor- and self-inhibition in a divisive manner obtains not only the best fit but also leads to effects beyond the shift and shrinkage of receptive fields as modeled previously.",

        "text": "Introduction: In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), data are commonly analyzed using general linear models (GLMs) [1]. In these models, correlated nuisance regressors can interact with regressors of interest and lead to biased parameter estimates as well as invalid statistical tests [2]. Following our previous work on cross-validated Bayesian model selection (cvBMS) [6,7,8], we present cross-validated Bayesian model averaging (cvBMA) to improve parameter estimates and enhance statistical tests based on GLMs for fMRI.\n\nMethods: In GLMs, fMRI data ($y$) are modelled as a linear combination ($\\beta$) of experimental conditions ($X$) with normally distributed errors ($\\varepsilon$): $y=X\\beta+\\varepsilon,\\;\\varepsilon\\sim\\text{N}(0,\\sigma^2V)$ [3,4]. For model averaging, GLMs are inverted using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation [1,2] and quantified by cross-validated log model evidences (cvLME) [6,7,8]. BMA estimates are then obtained by weighting ML estimates with posterior probabilities (PP) calculated from cvLMEs [5].\n\nResults: We investigate situations in which regressors of interest (e.g. representing targets) overlap with regressors of no interest (e.g. cues and feedbacks), so that including or omitting the latter has an influence on estimates for the former. Using simulated data, we show that BMA estimates have significantly lower mean-squared errors (MSE) than parameter estimates of even the best model as identified by maximal cvLME. Using empirical data from a conflict adaption paradigm [9], we find that different GLMs lead to different conclusions regarding experimental effects and that the most complex model is not necessarily the best choice. However, cvBMS can prevent from not detecting empirically plausible effects and cvBMA can increase sensitivity as compared to just using the subject-wise best models.\n\nDiscussion: In this work, we have introduced a method of model averaging for GLMs for fMRI to be employed when regressors of interest are contained in all models. Our findings indicate that cvBMA yields parameter estimates that are closer to their true values and provides statistical tests with lower false positive and higher true positive rates. We therefore envisage application for methodological control of models in cognitive neuroscience as well as inference on neural processing in computational neuroscience.",

        "text": "Models that incorporate the spatial extent of neocortex and axon transmission delays between neural populations are called neural field theories.  These models predict oscillations over the surface of the cortex that can exhibit high spatial coherence and have wave-like properties that depend primarily on the transmission delays between cortical populations; that is, on axon propagation speeds and length (Nunez and Srinivasan 2006; 2014). The dominant modes of these spatially distributed oscillations are often predicted to lie below about 15-20 Hz, i.e., in the theta and alpha bands of the human EEG. In contrast, in local networks models the dynamics are determined primarily by excitatory and inhibitory PSP delays and strengths of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, and are usually expressed as a set of nonlinear differential equations that capture the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  Local theories usually predict EEG signals and local field potentials with frequencies above 20 Hz. \nIn this study, we make use of a neural field theory that uses a linear approximation to local network interactions to derive a constrained vector auto-regressive model that can be used to model functional connectivity from EEG data.  By placing realistic physiological constraints on the structure of delays, we can estimate the delays and connection strengths between brain areas.    Critically, this approach incorporates the interaction between brain areas with finite transmission speeds into a generative model of the EEG dynamics.  This model fits both the location and functional connectivity that gives rise to the observed synchronous sources of the EEG.   In contrast, most EEG modeling emphasizes localization of sources, and implicitly assumes a local model of the generation of the EEG time series across all frequency ranges.    We first present results that confirm the performance of the model on synthetic data, and then apply it to real EEG data.  This approach has significant potential to enhance the information on functional connectivity in cognitive and clinical EEG studies.  ",

They learn features that allow to distinguish between classes by demanding that encodings of two trials from the same class are more similar to each other than to encoded trials from other classes. This tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets. \n\nThe proposed technique is evaluated using the publicly available OpenMIIR dataset [1] of EEG recordings taken while 9 subjects listened to 12 short music pieces. For this dataset, a simple convolutional filter can be learned that is stable across subjects and significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio while aggregating the 64 EEG channels into a single waveform. With this filter, a neural network classifier can be trained that is simple enough to allow for interpretation of the learned parameters by domain experts and facilitate findings about the cognitive processes. Further, a cross-subject classification accuracy of 27% is obtained with values above 40% for individual subjects.",

These can be measured with high precision in the CC, but are often invisible in the raw spike trains. \n\nHere we investigate the impact of small and imprecise phase delays in a stochastic spiking model that corresponds closely to experimental data. We derive optimal conditions on phase and rate parameters and on their combinations which maximize the probability to detect the correct stimulus. First, we find that pure rate, pure phase or mixed codes can be considered optimal depending on the chosen parameter range. Second, the increase in detection probability caused by the phase parameter increases with the number of stimuli and is usually relevant for at least $2^n$ stimuli, where $n$ denotes the number of neurons. With a Bayesian online change point detection algorithm we investigate the contribution of the phase to detecting changes in the stimulus. Here the phase reduces the required time horizon and the number of erroneous decisions.",

        "text": "There is strong evidence for the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in psychiatric disorders (e.g. major depression, schizophrenia) that are associated with abnormal prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. Treatments that target the serotonergic systems (e.g. SSRI, deep brain stimulation) show simultaneously improvement in behavioural symptoms and normalization of PFC activity. Besides that, the existence of bilateral projections between the PFC and the 5-HT production nucleus at the dorsal raphe (DRN) together with abundant expression of 5-HT receptors at the PFC output layers are indicatives of the importance of the PFC ‚Äì DR loop for behavioral control.\n\nDespite the vast literature on the theme, the underlying mechanisms that govern the PFC ‚Äì DR loop remain poorly understood. We present our recent efforts to characterize the joint activity of these circuits, specially breaking down the contributions of the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions of the mPFC. By means of electrical stimulation of the DR in rats, we provoke an acute release of 5-HT and record the activity simultaneously in both PreL and InfL subregions. We scrutinize the response to perturbation of different classes of neurons for each subregion. Next we investigate, with a conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire model, the theoretical contribution of different 5-HT receptors to the observed short term dynamics. ",

        "text": "Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning. A surprising recent result has been that feature representations from networks trained on a purely discriminative task can be used for state-of-the-art image synthesis (Gatys et al., 2015). However, it is still unclear what aspects of the pre-trained network are critical for high generative performance. It could be, for example, the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in terms of the number of layers, specific pooling techniques, the connection between filter complexity and filter scale (larger filters are more non-linear), the training task and the network‚Äôs performance on that task or the data it was trained on.\n\nTo explore the importance of learnt filters and deep architectures, we here consider the task of synthesising natural textures using only a single-layer CNN with completely random filters. Our surprising finding is that we can synthesise natural textures of high perceptual quality that sometimes even rival current state-of-the-art methods (Gatys et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016) which rely on deep, supervisedly trained multi-layer representations. We hence conclude that neither the supervised training nor the depth of the architecture is indispensable for natural texture generation.\n\nFurthermore, we evaluate the importance of other architectural aspects of random CNNs for natural texture synthesis. For that we introduce a new quantitative measure of texture quality based on the state-of-the-art parametric texture model by Gatys et al. This measure allows us to objectively quantify the performance of each architecture and perform a large-scale grid-search over CNNs with random filters and different architectures (in terms of numbers of layers, sizes of convolutional filters, non-linearities, pooling layers, numbers of feature maps within each layer). The main result is that larger filters and more layers help synthesising textures that are perceptually more similar to the original one, however, at the cost of less variability.",

        "text": "In Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) the STN plays an important role in the formation of pathological oscillatory activity within the basal ganglia-cortex loop. The primary measure to reveal such oscillations is the local field potential (LFP). While it is assumed that the LFP reflects synaptic input to groups of neurons, the relationship between this population signal and the single neuron activity is still a matter of debate [1, 2]. Our long-term goals are to investigate the spike-LFP relationship in STN recordings obtained during deep brain stimulation surgery, as well as to assess the amount of synchrony between individual neurons in order to elucidate how oscillations on the population level translate to neuronal synchrony.\nA critical step to achieve this goal is to correctly isolate the spiking activity of single units in extracellular STN recordings from Parkinson patients measured with a Ben Gun five channel micro-marcro-electrode holder. We employed a number of spike sorting algorithms [e.g., 3] and found that different spike sorting methods yield inconsistent results. We quantify these differences by the number of detected single units and the individual assignment of spikes to the detected units. Our long-term goal critically depends on the spike sorting quality [4], as, e.g., spike synchrony evaluation depends on the percentage of correctly identified spikes [5]. Hence, we introduced two additional approaches. Firstly, we developed a set of tools that estimates the isolation quality of single units [6]. These tools calculate the similarity of the spike shapes within one unit compared to other units. Secondly, we generated synthetic ground truth spike data of mixed units with the statistical features of the STN recordings: We selected the two most different spike shapes which we combined linearly to obtain pairs of spikes with  a controlled dissimilarity. Assuming Poisson spike rates we generated spike trains by inserting such spike pairs into a noisy background obtained by phase shifting the original noise. These data enable us to calibrate and verify our spike sorting results, i.e., to check if the number of extracted units and the spike-to-unit assignment is correct. By use of these two approaches, we compare and evaluate various spike sorting methods to finally select and apply the most appropriate one for the analysis of our STN recordings.",

        "text": "Understanding how assemblies of neurons encode information requires recording of large populations of cells in the brain. In recent years, multi-electrode arrays and large silicon probes have been developed to record simultaneously from thousands of electrodes packed with a high density. However, these new devices challenge the classical way to do spike sorting. First, the large number of electrodes preclude approaches based on manual clustering. Even automatic approaches need to be fast enough to handle the amount of extracellular data. Second, the density of the electrodes is high enough so that a single spike will be detected on many electrodes. So the different channels must be processed simultaneously. Third, within a large and dense array of electrodes, overlapping spikes are rather the rule than the exception, and it is known that classical clustering methods cannot easily capture the synchronous occurrence of two spikes from two different cells [1].\n\tHere we developed a new software to solve all these aforementioned issues, and show that this algorithm reached near optimal performance  both in vitro and in vivo. The algorithm is composed of two main steps: 1) a ‚Äútemplate-finding‚Äù phase to extract the cell templates, i.e. the pattern of activity evoked over many electrodes when one neuron fires an action potential; 2) a ‚Äútemplate-matching‚Äù phase where the templates are matched onto the raw data to find the location of the spikes. The manual intervention by the user is reduced to the minimal. For the template-finding phase, we start by detecting all the possible times in the raw data that could contain a spike. Spikes are then clustered into groups using a density-based clustering derived from [1], and we then extract the template corresponding to each group. In the fitting phase, we match the templates onto the raw data with a method that allows amplitude variation for each template [2]. The algorithm is entirely parallelized such that it can handle large amount of data. It also provides  a graphical user interface so that the output of the algorithm can be checked, and to refine the sorting. \n\tWe tested our algorithm with large-scale data from in vitro and in vivo recordings, from 32 and up to 4225 electrodes. In all cases, we estimated its performance on data with ground truth, i.e. cases where the solution to the sorting problem is at least partially known. The performance was always close to the maximal expected performance.",

        "text": "Linking of experimental results to spatial and temporal reference points is needed for comparative analysis of multiple heterogeneous data sets of brain structure and activity, obtained from different sources, with different resolutions and in different coordinate systems. Evaluation of automatic labeling detection is investigated in [1], with proposal of a new workflow for spatial analysis of labeling in microscopic sections.\nAnatomical reference points (landmarks) are based on the topological properties of the brain such as the shapes of sulci, gyri and fissures. In studies of the shape of sulcus authors present measuring brain variability via sulcus [2] and using of sulci as landmarks [3]. Functional reference points of brain activity are calculated from robust and similar values of measured parameters.\nThe characteristics of data mapping with different dimensions by reference points allow to perform defining of coordinate systems and scales. Standardized set of anatomical landmarks for registration and integration is proposed in [4]. Algorithms for automatically detection and matching of landmark curves on cortical surfaces to get an optimized brain conformal parametrization are presented in [5]. In [6] authors discuss multiple testing problems in brain imaging and propose single framework with using non-parametric combination methodology.\nSetting the scale by reference points determines the detalization level. This level in practice is limited due to resolution of measurements, and can be specially impaired for noise reduction. Highly resolved four-dimensional maps of human cortical processing of nonpainful somatosensory stimuli was generated in [7] as combination anatomical and functional data from intracerebral recordings.\nTime scales can be used to point out the characteristic times of events and intervals of the period of measurements. Concept of time scales is closely related to concept of synchronization.\nIntended purpose of scales and landmarks is to create of templates for pattern recognition and to highlight POIs and ROIs. Invariant combinations of reference points can be used as templates for brain sectors. \nThe present study illustrates the use of scales and landmarks for matching of MRI and CT data from different periods, describes the use of aggregated tomography data for mapping with detailed data from other sources. Also this paper considers biological significance of reference points as local places of impacts on nearby surroundings.",
