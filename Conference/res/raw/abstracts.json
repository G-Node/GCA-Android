        "text": "Perception of the environment requires developing models of and differentiating between externally and self-generated sensations.  We will discuss joint theoretical and experimental efforts that provide a detailed account of how specific neural circuitry and plasticity mechanisms support a well-defined and ethologically relevant neural computation of this type.  Past work has suggested that cerebellum-like circuitry in weakly electric mormyrid fish serves to predict and cancel self-generated input related to a stereotyped motor behavior--the electric organ discharge. We will discuss how such predictions, termed negative images, are generated at the circuit level: including how brief, highly stereotyped motor command signals are transformed into longer-lasting and more diverse temporal patterns in granule cells, the critical role for spike timing-dependent plasticity in sculpting negative images, and how the temporal structure of granule cell responses appears matched to the self-generated sensory input and also explains unexpected features of negative images. We will also discuss how these mechanisms may be extended to understand the more complex and ubiquitous problem of predicting the sensory consequences of movements.",

        "text": "Inhibitory neurons alter the computations performed by their target cells via two fundamental operations, division and subtraction. We show in mouse visual cortex in vivo that the critical feature underlying specific operations by somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) expressing neurons, the two inhibitory neuron classes that target pyramidal neurons,  is their response mode relative to target neurons. In particular, SOM neurons respond at long latencies to briefly flashed small visual stimuli, and provide subtractive inhibition when probed optogenetically with single pulses. With large stimuli, however, they respond at short latencies coincident with their target cells, and they switch to provide divisive inhibition crucial for gain control, similar to PV neurons.",

        "text": "Cortical neurons tend to show great heterogeneity in response properties during behavior. For instance, neurons in prefrontal cortex can encode mixtures of sensory, motor and other features with unique temporal dynamics, resulting in a ‘cortical response zoo’ that complicates the interpretation of neural responses. There is similar diversity in the cell-type-specific architecture of cortex, leading to the hypothesis that response heterogeneity may be in part explained by different neuron types. My talk will explore this hypothesis in the context of cortical inhibitory interneurons. To gain a better understanding into the behavioral roles of interneurons we employed an optogenetics-assisted cell type identification technique that allows us to electrophysiologically record from genetically identified neurons in freely moving mice. We studied the three major classes of interneurons, somatostatin  and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, which regulate the input and output of pyramidal neurons, respectively, and vasointestinal peptide-expressing interneurons that control other inhibitory interneurons. I will describe our results revealing that different interneuron types are recruited at specific behavioral moments and conditions. Thus the function of interneurons may go beyond network coordination at fast time scales. In conclusion I will describe an emerging model in which interneurons exert control over cortical information flow by selectively gating and modulating different input and output channels at behavioral time scales and governed by behavioral requirements.",

        "text": "Using millisecond-timescale voltage-sensitive dye imaging in lightly anesthetized or awake adult mice, we show that a palette of sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs are represented in spontaneous activity within the delta frequency band. These motifs can reflect multiple modes of sensory processing, including vision, audition and touch. We found similar cortical networks with direct cortical activation using channelrhodopsin-2. Regional analysis of activity spread indicated modality-specific sources, such as primary sensory areas, a common posterior-medial cortical sink where sensory activity was extinguished within the parietal association area and a secondary anterior medial sink within the cingulate and secondary motor cortices for visual stimuli. Correlation analysis between functional circuits and intracortical axonal projections indicated a common framework corresponding to regional long-range monosynaptic connections between cortical regions (defined using the Allen Inst. mouse connectivity atlas). Similar maps were observed with other indicators of neuronal activity such as intracellular calcium and measures of neurotransmitter release (glutamate imaging).  We anticipate that knowledge of these core structural and functional maps will be critical for study of both normal experience dependent changes to networks,  as well as pathological changes to following diseases such as stroke.",

On the other hand, methods in machine listening such as auditory-inspired feature extraction or multi-layer neural networks are by now sufficiently elaborate to improve psychoacoustic or physiological models. Examples include the prediction of human speech intelligibility and models of neural transformations in the human auditory cortex.

        "text": "Retinal degeneration leads to blindness due to gradual loss of photoreceptors. Information can be reintroduced into the visual system by patterned electrical stimulation of the remaining retinal neurons. Photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis directly converts light into pulsed electric current in each pixel, stimulating the nearby inner retinal neurons. Visual information is projected onto the retina by video goggles using pulsed near-infrared (~900nm) light. Subretinal arrays with 70mm photovoltaic pixels provide highly localized stimulation:  retinal ganglion cells respond to alternating gratings with the stripe width of a single pixel, which is half of the native resolution in healthy controls (~30mm). Similarly to normal vision, retinal response to prosthetic stimulation exhibits flicker fusion at high frequencies (>20 Hz), adaptation to static images, and non-linear summation of subunits in the receptive fields. In rats with retinal degeneration, the photovoltaic subretinal arrays provide visual acuity up to half of its normal level (~1 cpd), as measured by the cortical response to alternating gratings. If these results translate to human retina, such implants could restore visual acuity up to 20/250. With eye scanning and perceptual learning, human patients might even cross the 20/200 threshold of legal blindness. Ease of implantation and tiling of these wireless modules to cover a large visual field, combined with high resolution opens the door to highly functional restoration of sight.",

        "text": "Myoelectric control consists in the recording of EMG signals for extracting control signals to command external devices, such as hand prostheses. In commercial systems, the intensity of muscle activity is extracted from the EMG and used for single degree of freedom activation (direct control). Over the past 60 years, the academic research has progressed to more sophisticated approaches but, surprisingly, none of these academic achievements has been implemented in commercial systems so far. The academic state-of-the-art relies on pattern recognition as a method to control multiple motor tasks using a relatively small number of electrodes. After several decades of development, this approach still shows major limitations, thus a change of focus on myocontrol research may be needed. Novel approaches, recently proposed, include techniques for simultaneous and proportional control of multiple degrees of freedom, which are based on regression methods. Moreover, it seems evident that the exclusive use of EMG as a source for feed-forward control of prostheses poses important limitations. These limits can be partly overcome by including additional sensors, within semiautonomous systems. Finally, sensory feedback is essential in prosthetic control, thus there is the need to introduce robust and intuitive methods for sensory substitution. The talk will cover these approaches with a discussion on the major challenges in filling the gap between commercial/clinical and academic methods for myocontrol.",

Much previous work has speculated about the existence of specialized pathways for the processing of either pitch or space or timbre, either in topographic maps or specialized streams. In this talk I will summarize recent work which questions this view and instead proposes a closely intertwined neural representation of the perceived features of real world sounds.",

I will introduce the current state-of-the-art approaches for in vivo calcium imaging and present examples of the recent application of for measuring neocortical dynamics in behaving mice. For example, we train mice in a texture discrimination task and analyze the activation patterns of identified cortico-cortically projecting neurons. We also utilize running wheels to study aspects of the cortical control of locomotion.

        "text": "The principle of efficient coding has been quite successful in explaining the tuning of neurons to sensory stimuli across a diversity of systems (e.g. work by Olshausen & Field, Smith & Lewicki, Salinas, among others). Balanced networks have been successful in providing mechanistic explanations for the irregularity of firing in neural systems, and have led to the subsequent experimental verification of a balance between inhibitory and excitatory conductances (e.g. work by Shadlen & Newsome, van Vreeswijk & Sompolinksy, Brunel, etc.). We here show that both theories can be derived from a single principle: efficient coding with spikes. Starting with this simple objective, we show how a network of integrate-and-fire neurons can learn to first balance itself and then encode its inputs efficiently, using only local learning rules. Both the integrate-and-fire network dynamics, and the learning rules, are directly derived from objective functions. One consequence of our theory is a networks' ability to instantaneously restore its function when part of a circuit is perturbed or knocked out. This optimal compensation leads to instantaneous changes in the tuning of neurons after perturbations, and we compare our theoretical results with experimental knock-out studies in several sensory systems. The limits of restoration depend on the nature of the disruption. [Joint work with David Barrett, Ralph Bourdoukan, Wieland Brendel, Pietro Vertecchi, and Sophie Deneve.]",

        "text": "Psychological and neurophysiological studies of decision-making have focused primarily on scenarios in which subjects are faced with choices that are stable in time, permitting a serial process of representing the relevant information, careful deliberation about the choice, followed by action planning and execution. However, the brain evolved to interact with a dynamic and constantly changing world, in which the choices themselves as well as their relative costs and benefits are defined by the momentary geometry of the immediate environment and are continuously changing during ongoing activity. To deal with the demands of real-time interactive behavior, animals require a neural architecture in which the sensorimotor specification of potential actions, their valuation, selection, and even execution can all take place in parallel. I will describe a general hypothesis for how the brain deals with the challenges of such dynamic and embodied behavior. I will then present the results of a series of behavioral and neurophysiological experiments in which humans and monkeys make decisions on the basis of sensory information that changes over time. These experiments suggest that sensory information pertinent to decisions is processed quickly and combined with a growing signal related to the urge to act, and the result biases a competition between potential actions that takes place within the same sensorimotor circuits that guide action. I will also show data suggesting that a common mechanism controls both the urgency to make a decision as well as the vigor of the selected movement, yielding a unified policy for maximizing reward rates.",

        "text": "In this talk, I will present the dynamics of neuronal activity in two areas of the posterior parietal cortex that support looking and reaching, area LIP and the parietal reach region, PRR. We identify neurons in area LIP and PRR that fire coherently with LFP activity recorded locally in the same area as well as long-range in the other area. We then study the relationship of the firing of the coherent neurons to on-going behavior. The coherently-active neurons appear to play a privileged role in decisions about where to look and reach as well as in how we coordinate look-reach movements. I will discuss how the results are broadly consistent with a role for spike-field coherence in inter-areal communication.",

        "text": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuronal prostheses which allow deaf people to hear and understand speech, but noise and reverberation create problems. A second CI delivers binaural information, often providing some source localization ability. Binaural temporal information is particularly important for localization in reverberant space. CI users with higher sensitivity to interaural time difference (ITDs) showed greater robustness against reverberation (Kerber and Seeber, 2013). Seeber and Monaghan (2013) presented a method which enhances selected sound onsets to increase the salience of the ITD cues transmitted. The approach sets the envelope to zero immediately prior to those envelope peaks with a direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) above a threshold. This improved sound localization in reverberation in simulated listening with CIs.\n\nWe investigated the DRR near peaks in envelopes processed similar to CIs. Speech sounds were convolved with room impulse responses of different rooms and source-receiver configurations. The envelope was extracted from the reverberated speech in frequency-specific channels. The DRR was generally largest at or prior to a peak, indicating that envelope peaks coincide statistically with the moments where direct sound energy dominates over reverberant energy.\n\nVariations of the onset enhancement algorithm were evaluated in a lateralization and a speech test for different source-receiver distances. Onset enhancement improved lateralization performance compared to no enhancement. Lateralization was slightly increased when the enhancement occurred at the peak instead of prior to it. Speech intelligibility measured was not affected by the onset enhancement. In conclusion, the onset enhancement approach has been confirmed to improve localization performance in reverberant spaces using simulated listening with CIs. Since it did not impair speech intelligibility it can be suggested as a method for improving binaural hearing with CIs.",

        "text": "Controlling advanced upper limb prostheses by applying pattern recognition to electromyography (EMG) signals is promising, however the approach still lacks commercial breakthrough. One reason for this failure may be that only very few studies currently report testing of new prosthetic control systems by users employing physical prostheses in daily life activities, which are anyway limited to controlled laboratory environment. In this work, we describe a software prototyping approach that allows surpassing these limitations. By implementing a control algorithm on a smartphone and using wireless communication with a prosthesis worn by an amputee, the experimental setup is freed from laboratory equipment and tests can be conducted in activities of daily living of end-users. Moreover, high flexibility is maintained through the user interface on the phone and amenities of high level programming languages can be exploited, which are necessary features for effective research.\nFor this study, a novel control method was implemented on an HTC One S smartphone, featuring a 1.5GHz processor with 1GB RAM and running the Android 4.1.2 operating system. A custom application was created, connecting to a Michelangelo hand prosthesis (Ottobock HealthCare Products GmbH) via Bluetooth. The transmitted EMG data were processed in real-time (i.e., without user-perceivable delay) on the phone and control commands were sent back to the prosthesis. \nThe preliminarily evaluated system will facilitate amputee user testing in the laboratory and more importantly environments of the daily living, e.g. at home, work or leisure time. The results of this work will provide insights in the true benefit of the novel prosthetic control for end-users in real-life tests, gained by leveraging the computational power of today’s smartphones for the use of rapid software prototyping. Beside the system tested, the proposed system can be used for testing any other control system, with any type of prosthesis.",

        "text": "Modern hand prostheses are flexible systems with an intuitive control for restoring motor functions, but with no somatosensory feedback [1]. The prosthesis state can be transmitted to the user by delivering electrical pulses to the skin, eliciting tactile sensations [2], [3]. In order to design effective feedback, the response of the human subject during closed-loop control using electrotactile stimulation needs to be investigated [4].  In this study, four able-bodied subjects (25±4 yrs) used a joystick to control dynamic systems [SYS1 = 1/s+1, SYS2 = 2/s(0.25s+1)], simulating the behavior of a prosthesis. The reference trajectory was a pseudorandom multisine (Fig. 1[c] and [e]). The momentary tracking error was provided by delivering stimulation via two electrodes placed on the forearm. For each trial, the human frequency response was identified (cross-spectral analysis) and then a linear transfer function (Fig. 1[a] and [b]) was fitted (prediction error estimation). Finally, the transfer function was applied to predict (Fig. 1[d] and [f]) the human response (joystick signal).  The outcome measure was the cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) between the reference and generated trajectory (Fig. 1[c]), and the estimated and actual response (Fig. 1[d] and [f]). The results demonstrated that the subjects were able to accommodate both dynamic systems, with the worse performance for SYS2 (CCC=82±10% vs. CCC= 87±7%, p < 0.01 t-test). The linear models captured the main features of the human response, although the control strategies for handling the two systems were different (Fig. 1[d] vs. [f]). The prediction was less good for SYS2 (CCC=72±13% vs. CCC=79±8%, p < 0.01 t-test). The limited estimation quality implies the existence of non-linear control strategies, which became more dominant as the difficulty of the control task increased (SYS2). More advanced models will be tested in the future to refine the estimation of human behavior in electrotactile feedback systems.",

        "text": "Low-level electrical pulses delivered to the skin to elicit tactile sensations (electrotactile stimulation) can be used to provide feedback to the user about the state of a myoelectric prosthesis [1]. However, the stimulation corrupts the recorded myoelectric signals, thereby interfering with the control. One approach to avoid the stimulation artifacts is to implement time-division multiplexing (TDM), in which the stimulation (feedback) and recording (control) are performed in non-overlapping time windows [2], [3]. In the current study, nine able-bodied subjects used myocontrol to command a model of a prosthesis so that the hand aperture followed a predefined reference trajectory comprising a sequence of hand closing/opening (Fig. 1[a] and [b]). Momentary tracking error was fed back to the subjects using electrotactile stimulation with continuous feedback and control (CONT) and with TDM. The stimulation and recording windows for TDM were set to 120 ms. The control command was computed using the data collected within the recording window and then kept constant until the next update. The outcome measures were root mean square tracking error (RMSTE) and time delay between the reference and generated trajectories. The quality of tracking when using TDM was good (Fig. 1[a] and [b]) but the average control performance was worse (Fig. 1[c] and [d]) compared to CONT (p < 0.001 t-test). This was despite the fact that the task dynamics was rather slow (Fig. 1[a] and [b]) and that both the command and feedback were updated at least 4 times per second, which is higher than the human control bandwidth (~2 Hz). It seems that briefly but periodically interrupting the afferent stream was enough to decrease the ability of the subject to perceive and/or process the feedback information. This effect likely depends on the duration of the feedback window. The next step is to test TDM with different feedback window duration and for the control of a real myoelectric prosthesis.",

        "text": "Myoelectric activity can easily be recorded through surface electrodes, placed on the skin above the muscles of interest. These signals can be used for a variety of medical and biomedical applications. However, several factors limit the usefulness of surface electromyograms (EMGs): sweating modifies electrode impedance, and movements change the electrode location relative to the muscles. Moreover cross-talk limits the capacity to pick up signals from small or deep muscles [1]. These aspects particularly impair the reliability of EMG-based prosthetic devices, which require long-term stability of the conditioned signal. Conversely, signals recorded internally are more reliable, but typically require acute recordings that are unsuited for prosthetic use. Here we show that signals recorded from a fully implanted, induction-powered wireless system allow to continuously decode proportional force information. This implant, developed in the context of the Myoplant project [2], transmits up to four channels of EMG activity, using bipolar epimysial electrodes. Two Rhesus macaques received implants, which have currently been functioning for 5 months. Electrodes were placed in the upper arm (biceps, triceps, and over two fiber groups of the deltoid). One of the monkeys was trained to do a cursor task via a haptic robot, which allowed us to control the forces exerted to/by the animal during arm movements. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to decode time-varying force profiles during a simple two dimensional reach task. Importantly, a decoder trained with data from a single day maintained an accurate decoding performance during the following weeks. The decoding performance was compared with standard surface EMG recordings conducted simultaneously. Results show that a fully implantable, intramuscular wireless system is particularly suited for applications requiring continuous force decoding such as advanced forelimb prosthetic devices with multiple degrees of freedom.",

        "text": "Objective:  To improve existing retinal prostheses by incorporating visual coding of the retina.  From visual and electrical responses of over 2000 retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), we have seen that the diversity of visual response types is also accompanied by a broad diversity of electrical response types.  Therefore, we sought to develop effective methods to quantify and classify these different visual and electrical responses to see whether specific visual RGC types correlate to specific electrical response types.\nMethods:  Mouse RGC spike trains were recorded with a multi-electrode array from the isolated retina (wild-type and degenerated rd10 strains) during epiretinal stimulation with square wave, monophasic pulses of varying voltage and duration as well as during visual stimulation with full-field flashes (2 sec ON, 2 sec OFF).\nResults:  Only about half of RGCs respond to electrical stimulation.  Surprisingly, many RGCs do not respond to increasing electrical stimulus with a sigmoidal function.  Furthermore, electrical responses frequently occur during one or more specific epochs of time after stimulation.  The diversity of response patterns appears to reflect the diversity of network inputs and physiological properties across the RGC population.  In a preliminary analysis, we found no correlation between electrical response latency, and visual response latency, duration, amplitude, or ON/OFF index.\nConclusions:  This analysis requires a large database of paired visual and electrical responses to stimuli that are sophisticated enough for discrimination of ~20 distinct RGC types.  We continue to assess whether additional data and better analyses can identify RGC types with unique visual and electrical response patterns.  If we are successful, it may become possible in the degenerate retina to functionally identify RGCs in the absence of visual responses - in turn, enabling the application of more sophisticated visual coding in retinal prostheses.",

        "text": "The analysis of impairments on cognitive tests due to brain lesions is undoubtedly the root of cognitive neuroscience and has led to tremendous insights into the neural substrate of cognitive functions. Voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) (1) introduced mass-univariate analyses developed for fMRI to lesion mapping allowing for a hitherto unknown neuroanatomical precision in lesion mapping. Here, we undertake a new step and combine VLSM with computational modeling by fitting a cognitive model with interpretable parameters to the neuropsychological data whose neural correlates are then mapped with VLSM. We used a large sample of lesion patients (n=306) who have been administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a canonical measure of executive control that detects impairments in set switching. We selected a recent computational model of the WCST (2) that describes the cognitive process as a gradual shift of attention weights to the 3 sorting dimensions. These weights are updated in proportion to a feedback signal that determines the weights eligible for updating based on the current sort of the subject. The model has 4 parameters: reward and punishment sensitivity (PS) regulate the proportional updating of the attention weights, decision consistency models the stochasticity of the choices, and attentional focussing regulates the extent of the updating of all weights.  Model parameters were determined using hierarchical Bayesian estimation and MCMC sampling with JAGS. Simulated data exhibited very similar WCST standard scores thus confirming a good model fit. VLSM analyses of the model parameters revealed a large effect for PS in the right prefrontal cortex (including insula) and the underlying white matter. This effect largely overlapped with the neural substrate for perseverative error, one of the hallmarks of impaired executive control. Regression analysis showed that PS is the most important model parameter for predicting perseverative errors. Conceptu",

        "text": "Neurophysiological recordings of the same task often vary from each repetition of the experiment (trial) to the next (e.g. [1,2]). Trial-to-trial variability has been observed in multiple modalities of neural recordings (e.g. [1-3]) and it has been studied using a variety of techniques ranging from multivariate statistics  to information-theoretic approaches [2].  Identifying the functional role of this observed variability is an essential question in neuroscience; however gaining a fundamental insight into trial-to-trial dynamics in ensemble recordings is still a major challenge.\nIn this study we present an empirical criterion to discern whether the observed trial-to-trial variability in neural ensembles is essentially driven by stochastic transitions among stable states, as often assumed [2] or by deterministic processes.\nFirst, we present empirical evidence of attracting dynamics in prefrontal cortex ensembles during decision making tasks; and how this dynamic landscape is modulated on a trial-by-trial basis [4]. Next, we evaluate the capacity of a simple statistic based on the behaviour of trajectories in classification settings, the trajectory coherence, in order to identify the origin of trial-to-trial dynamics [5]. Towards this goal we first devised a parsimonious model of non-stationary classification problems [6] and then estimated the coherence of class-trajectories in reconstructed state spaces. We show how this analysis can discern subtle variations attributable to deterministic processes from stochastic fluctuations. \nIn a final stage, we analyse the coherency of neural trajectories in rat's frontal cortex ensemble activity during a decision-making task. Results suggest that, in line with recent hypotheses, rather than internal noise, it is the deterministic trend which could underlie the observed trial-to-trial variability [7]. Thus, this approach potentially enable us to infer empirically the source of variability dynamics in in vivo recordings [5].",

        "text": "Striatum (Str) is the critical structure in various cognitive processes. The direct and indirect pathways of dorsal Str determine the actions in performing goal directed behaviors [1]. Ventral Str (nucleus accumbens-NAc) calculates the reward value of tasks and the error in expectation [2]. This reward value may alter an action decision even when the dorsal striatal output is against it, especially for effort-related decision making processes [3]. Recent research shows that both ventral and dorsal Str take part in decision making processes [4]. Striatal processing of a stimulus under the presence of dopamine (DA) signaling from midbrain neurons produces the stimulation to the motor circuits of the brain.\nWe compare the results of two computational models to study the effects of neural synchronization in action initiation. Both models integrate the outputs of dorsal and ventral striatal structures to show that through the striato-nigro-striatal pathway, limbic regions have impact on the motor regions of the basal ganglia. The first model uses conductance based neuron models to demonstrate the physiological properties of neurons in each basal ganglia structure. Each brain structure is represented by a single neuron. Striatal neurons are modeled as two groups which have D1 or D2 type DA receptors. This model is simulated on MATLAB.\nThe second model realizes the same network by using AdEx type neurons and demonstrating each brain structure by 100 neurons. The neuron groups are randomly connected with a sparseness factor of 0.1. Total neural activity of each neuron group is studied via raster plots. This model is simulated with BRIAN neuron simulator.\nThe results of both models show that ventral striatal structures can modify the action decisions even when connections are sparse and random and neural firing frequencies vary. The dynamics of the designed neural circuitry can be efficiently used in computational neuroscience to understand the cognitive processes.",

        "text": "Robotic systems can perform well-defined tasks with exquisite precision at high speeds, but they have much more difficulty when operating in unstructured environments. Improved spatial navigation skills would increase autonomy of robots and would extend the range of tasks they could potentially address. Standard solutions integrate different sensory signals to localize a robot’s position with reference to external objects. However, such localization algorithms only work well in static surroundings. On the contrary, animals such as rats and humans effortlessly adapt to new environments and learn to orient themselves even in dynamical situations. With the discovery of place cells and grid cells, neuroscientists are starting to disclose the mechanisms underlying spatial navigation skills in animals. In this work we propose a neuromorphic architecture for robotic spatial navigation that aims at taking advantage of the flexibility and robustness of biological neural networks. Our architecture runs on the neuromorphic hardware SpiNNaker, a massively-parallel computing architecture specifically designed to model large-scale spiking neural networks (Khan et al. 2008). We take advantage of SpiNNaker’s support for PyNN, a simulator-independent language for modeling spiking neural networks and we adapt existing models of grid and place cells based on recent experimental evidence (Couey et al. 2013). We validate our neural controller on a mobile robot that continuously acquires odometric and visual information about its motion and its local position to update its internal spatial representation. The neuromorphic architecture drives the robot in dependence of pre-set goal locations that affect the neural dynamics. The close integration of goals and sensory information could be crucial to build robotic systems that can ultimately match human spatial navigation performance.",

        "text": "Motor synergies have been supposed to simplify motor control [1]-[5]. In order to test it, we exploit the correlations of our hand's joints to discover some underlying simplicity in a complex stream of behavioral actions. Instead of averaging variability out, we take the view that the structure of variability may contain valuable information about the task being performed. Therefore, we asked 7 subjects to interact in 17 daily-life situations and quantified behavior in principled manner using cyber glove technology. We combined Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) with a Bayesian classifier to analyze the data. Our key findings are: 1. we confirmed that hand control is low-dimensional, where 4-5 dimensions were sufficient to explain 80-90% of the variability in the movement data [6]. 2. We established a universally applicable measure of manipulative complexity that allowed us to measure this quantity across vastly different tasks. 3. We discovered that within the first 1000 ms of an action the hand shape already configures itself to vastly different tasks, enabling us to reliable predict the action intention [6]. 4. We suggest how using the statistics of natural finger movements paired with Bayesian latent variable model can be used to infer the movements of missing limbs from existing limbs to control e.g. a prosthetic device. Overall, these predictabilities could be used to build intelligent Neuroprosthetics for lost fingers that implement the task from the movement of the remaining limbs.",

        "text": "AIM: In this paper we propose a novel simultaneous and proportional multiple degree of freedom (DOF) control method for active prostheses. The method is based on non-negative matrix factorization of EMG signals, as previously proposed [1], but is enhanced by the application of sparseness constraints.\nMETHODS:  In [1], a control scheme for active prostheses is based on EMG factorization, as:\n\n$${\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^2(t)}}_{N \\times t} = \\mathbf{W}_{N \\times L} \\cdot {\\mathbf{F}(t)}_{L \\times t}$$\n\n$${\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^2(t)}}_{N \\times t} = \\left[ \\cdots, W_i^+, W_i^-, \\cdots \\right] \\left[  \\begin{array} {c} \\vdots \\\\ {f_i^+}(t) \\\\ {f_i^-}(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\end{array} \\right]$$\n\nwhere ${\\widehat{\\mathbf{Z}^2(t)}}_{N \\times t}$ represents the root mean square (RMS) value of the N-channel surface EMG recording, $\\mathbf{W}$ is the matrix of the basis control signal, and $\\mathbf{F}(t)$ is the coefficient matrix of $\\mathbf{W}$. ${W_i}$ is the individual basis control signal, and it is a column vector, ${f_i(t)}$ is the time series, and it is a row vector, N represents the number of electrodes, and L the number of the basis control signal. Eq. (1) satisfies the NMF frame. To this basic scheme, we applied a sparseness constraint NMF, nsNMF [2], to the columns of $\\mathbf{F}(t)$.  \nRESULTS: Compared with the standard NMF, in the training stage, the sparseness constraint NMF can extract the basis control information in one step, instead of the DoF-wise approach in [1]. In the testing stage, the simultaneous control performance of nsNMF is similar to that of the standard NMF, as shown in Fig.1.  \nCONCLUSION: An improved scheme to the NMF based simultaneous and proportional multiple-DOF prostheses control system is described. By applying a sparseness constraint to F(t), in training stage, the basis control signal can be extracted in one step. And in the testing stage, the simultaneous control performance of nsNMF is similar to that of the standard NMF.",

        "text": "When two opposing force fields are presented on subsequent movements, substantial motor interference occurs and neither force field is learned (1,2). We recently showed that immediate prior movement acts as a contextual cue reducing motor interference during the learning of opposing force fields (3). Here we examine if future movements affect motor learning in a similar fashion.\n\nFirst, subjects performed a two-part movement, from the start to a central via-point and then on to a target, either leftward or rightward of the initial direction. On the first movement, a randomly selected clockwise or counter-clockwise velocity-dependent curl field was applied, where the second movement was predictive of its field direction. The second movement direction could act as a contextual cue for field direction, and indeed led to a significant reduction in interference.\n\nNext, we investigated if subjects could employ both future and past movement contextual cues simultaneously. Subjects performed adaptation movements between two via points in randomly selected opposing curl fields, where the field direction was specified by both prior and future movements. After substantial training, subjects could simultaneously utilize both past and future movement contexts to produce a XOR-like adaptation to the force fields.\n\nFinally, we examined if future motion affects learning a single force field. We hypothesized that if dynamic learning were followed by variable follow-through movements (1 of 9), each would partition learning in the preceding movement. In contrast, a single follow-though movement would result in no partitioning, and therefore faster learning. We compared the two conditions finding significantly faster learning with a single follow-through.\n\nOverall our results suggest that information arising from future motor planning can not only influence the formation and recall of multiple motor memories, but also affect learning a single set of dynamics.\n",

An increasingly explicit set of neuroscientific ideas has been established for habit formation centering on the temporal-difference learning account of phasic dopamine response, whereas goal-directed control just started to attract researchers' attention. While using functional magnetic resonance imaging to address the involvement of brain areas abounds, ideas on the algorithmic and neural level are scarce.\nIn this talk, we suggest an algorithm based on dynamic programming for goal-directed control in animals and humans and present a neural network implementation that solves the Bellman equation using biologically realistic neurons and synapses. Finding the solution, commonly considered a hard optimization problem, can be accomplished quickly when using a surprisingly simple neural network. We theoretically prove the convergence of the neural dynamics to the optimal value function. Further, we present how the environmental model can be learned using a local synaptic plasticity rule. Function approximation extends the applicability of the model from discrete to continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the applicability of the model by presenting simulations results on various benchmark tasks from the machine learning literature, yielding competitive results.",

        "text": "Neurons in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and parietal reach region (PRR) can simultaneously encode two alternative motor goals when monkeys have equal preference to choose either goal. This is true even if goals are selected based on two competing spatial transformation rules. Here, we test if graded preferences for such rule-based reach goals are reflected in graded spatial selectivity of individual neurons.\nA monkey had to determine the correct reach goal from two instructive cues. A spatial pre-cue consisted of two differently colored triangles, pointing to two opposite directions. The pre-cue indicated, first, the two possible goals in a given trial, located at $90^0$ clockwise and counterclockwise relative to its own position (rules). Second, the triangle sizes could differ and represented the probability with which the rule guided by each triangle would be instructed later. After a delay, a spatially neutral color cue was presented. In instructed trials the color matched to one of the pre-cue triangles and indicated the valid rule. In interspersed free-choice trials the color was neutral and both potential goals were rewarded with equal amount and probability.\nPreliminary results show that the pre-cue successfully induced a graded preference in the monkey: The alternative which was more likely to be instructed was chosen more often and faster in free-choice trials where there was no objective advantage from selecting this alternative. The spatial selectivity of individual PMd and PRR neurons during motor planning was modulated in accordance with the degree of later choice bias.\nWe conclude that in a rule-based motor goal selection task, the probability with which a rule is instructed induces a reward-independent subjective preference in free-choice behavior. The degree of behavioral preference is reflected in the degree of spatial selectivity of individual neurons in PRR and PMd corroborating the relevance of both areas in rule-based motor goal selection.",

        "text": "During visually guided reach planning, neurons in monkey parietal reach region (PRR) and dorsal pre-motor cortex (PMd) encode task-relevant spatial information. When reaches are directed towards objects then object shape and size partly determine the relevant space for motor planning. Accordingly, we could show that reach goals are encoded not only relative to the own body or gaze direction (egocentric reference frames), but also relative to the target object (object-centered reference frame) in these areas [1]. Here we test if not only the object position influences the center of reference for spatial selectivity in PRR and PMd, but also if the object size determines the spatial scaling (tuning width) of the neural selectivity. Further, we test if object-centered encoding is temporally stable or specific to specific stages of reach planning [2]. \nA rhesus monkey was trained to conduct an object-based reach task. The monkey had to memorize a briefly flashed peripheral visual cue which could occur at one of five locations relative to a memorized extended visual object. After a first delay period (visual memory) the object but not the cue re-occurred. After a second delay (motor planning) the monkey had to reach to the previously cued target location on the object. The first and second object occurrence could be at congruent or incongruent spatial locations. The object had always the same shape, but could be of the same or different size in both occurrences.\nPreliminary results suggest that PRR and PMd switch their encoding from predominantly object-centered during the visual memory period to predominantly egocentric during movement planning. We also found that a subset of neurons scaled their spatial selectivity with the size of the object. \nOur results suggest that neurons in PRR and PMd dynamically adjust their spatial selectivity to the behaviorally relevant spatial space, including spatial parameters of target objects.\n",

        "text": "One of the main challenges in decision neuroscience lies in the fact that humans do not make decisions alone, but rather are affected by their social environment. Particularly, besides making choices according to the action-outcome association, humans tend to align their behavior with the others, even without any direct social interaction. A long tradition of economic and social psychological studies has demonstrated a robust effect of social influence and conformity on perceptual decision making (Asch, 1951). However, relatively little is known about what is the nature of the computations carried out by human minds to achieve optimal decisions when social influence is presented. To this aim, we developed a novel experimental paradigm which allows for investigating real-time interaction between multiple players while engaging in a probabilistic decision-making task under uncertainty. By employing computational modeling techniques from reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we show that the decision making process involves two reinforcement learning signals. Specifically, besides the reward prediction error (RPE), there exists a social prediction error (SPE), by which the difference between one’s own selection and group choices is computed. We found that the mixed RL model with weighted combination of RPE and SPE could provide a better fit to participants’ behavior than does RL model with RPE or SPE alone. We further observed that, the combination between expected values and the others’ choices were computed using a weighted average that reflects each player’s reliability (i.e., how successful the other has performed of the last few trials). These findings provide evidence that social influences exerted by the group members could be used to refine initial decisions and predict future behavior change.",

        "text": "Task instruction is a key component of any psychological experiment, yet little is known about the process by which instructions are encoded. In a previous study, we have attempted to measure the speed of the encoding process by varying the time delay before a retrieval request and measuring variations of the response time (Bugmann et al., 2013). The results were explained by constraints on the time available for Hebbian synaptic learning during the time delay. A completely different analysis is proposed here, inspired by properties of the attentional blink (Shapiro et al. 1997).  A blocking instruction encoding process is assumed, during which requests for instruction retrieval are queued and are executed only after encoding is completed.  Interestingly, the attentional blink literature shows that the queued request can be masked out by another sensory input. We have tested this interpretation in an experiment with or without masking. The experiment (see fig) consists of showing to a subject a Stimulus-Response task rule for tsr=200ms, then showing a mask 1 during a variable delay (delay=50-1300ms), then showing a Stimulus at time ts either for up to 5 sec or until the Response is produced (unmasked condition) or showing the Stimulus only for 100ms, followed by a mask 2 (masked condition). Our computational model of the attentional blink hypothesis fits the response time data well (see fig) by assuming a Gamma distribution of encoding times with a peak at 340 ms, and an additional random time td_av =500 ms taken by a subject to respond in the masked runs.  The model reflects the assumption that the duration of the attentional blink is the time required for instruction encoding. How can this be verified? If encoding were through synaptic learning, would the encoding time follow a Gamma distribution? How would the brain detect the completion of learning to end the attentional blink?",

        "text": "A system that is used to control a device based on the brain’s activity without using the normal output pathways of peripheral nerves is a so called brain-computer interface (BCI). BCIs processing steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) have a high information transfer rate (ITR). Changing the stimulation sequence to code-based VEP (c-VEP) promises better accuracy and higher ITR. In this work we investigate the online accuracy of an ECoG based BCI, which is decoding c-VEPs that are generated by visual stimuli embedded within a video-application.\nA 63 bit m-sequence was used for visual stimulation in combination with a 60 Hz monitor. Data were acquired with 256Hz and then band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 30 Hz. A patient suffering from intractable epilepsy participated in the experiment after implantation of clinical subdural electrodes. Eight ECoG channels covering the visual cortex were recorded to get the best c-VEPs. The experiment was separated into a calibration run (i) and an online accuracy run to test the classifier (ii). In (i) the subject was asked to gaze at a rectangular control element on the screen, which was flickering over 200 stimulation cycles. The derived signals were used to compute a classifier based on the canonical correlation analysis between averaged VEPs and the individual recorded trials. After calibration, the patient performed the second task (ii), in which four visual targets were presented on the screen simultaneously showing a phase shifted version of the calibration sequence. Specifically, the patient performed 20 trials including 3 s blank screen and then 7 s of visual stimulation. A linear classifier identified the current selection based on the correlation coefficients between a 2.1 s ECoG buffer and the calibration templates. After finishing task (ii), the subject achieved an online accuracy of 90 %. Therefore, the experiment successfully showed that intracranial c-VEPs can be used to setup a continuous controlled BCI.",

        "text": "Aberrations of synchronous neuronal activity have been correlated with a multitude of neurological disorders. While the pathophysiology of these brain disorders is both distinct and unresolved, pathological hypersynchronization of neuronal groups has been consistently reported. Additionally, human, animal, and theoretical studies have demonstrated a shift back towards physiological state concomitant with desynchronization of the abnormal activity. \nModels of plasticity have been derived to simulate and explain network dynamics with high levels of synchronization. Spike time dependent plasticity (STDP), has been explored and extrapolated to disorders of hypersynchrony. Circuit function with respect to disorders of synchrony, however, must also include hyposynchrony such as described in TS; yet, there are virtually no reports addressing this regime.\nRecently, chronic recordings from the human thalamus demonstrated a correlation between low gamma synchrony and positive symptoms of the disorder (tics). Despite being persistent, tic expression waxes and wanes, however the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. I propose that the governing dynamic is one of alternation between strongly and weakly synchronized states, representing the waning and the waxing modes of tic expression. By considering STDP in this regime, the two states coexist in the network with synaptic strength dictating the level of synchrony. A model for this bistability has been described as the Sisyphus Effect, in which a network is characterized by spontaneous fluctuations between the two levels of synchrony.\nUnder conditions of STDP, a network can be moved into either a synchronized, desynchronized, or bistable state. Additionally, by means of feed forward inhibition, such as occurs in the recurrent loop of TS, GABA can control STDP by reversing its polarity. These processes can be used to increase neuronal coordination from the hyposynchronized pathological state to a normal physiologic one.",

        "text": "Memory of a linked list of attractor waypoints has been proposed [1] to account for the ability of insects such as desert ants  to follow extended routes through cluttered environments without chemical trails [2]. However, an alternative explanation [3] is that at each point on the route, the ant could rotate until the difference of the current image from any stored snapshot is minimized; this tends to be the direction it needs to go to move along the route. We show that this method is effective when tested in a realistic simulation of the visual experience of ants based on ecologically relevant data. But how could the ant’s brain implement this mechanism? We explored whether our previously developed model of olfactory learning in the MB of fruit flies [4] could also explain ant route following. The odour pattern activating the projection neuron (PN) layer is replaced by a 10x36 pixel image experienced by the simulated ant as it moves along the route. The Kenyon cell (KC) layer of 20,000 spiking neurons is innervated in a random pattern (i.e., not preserving retinotopy) such that each KC gets input from 10 PNs, and needs coincident activation from several PNs to fire. All KC outputs converge on a single extrinsic neuron (EN). Learning takes place at the KC-EN synapses, and is controlled by a three-factor rule [5]: spike timing dependent plasticity tags the KC synapses that were active shortly before or after EN firing and is combined with a reinforcement signal which permanently decreases the strength of tagged synapses. After training with route images, the rate of spiking in the EN corresponds to ‘novelty’ of visual input. By choosing the heading that produces the lowest firing, the simulated ant is able to recapitulate the route. The mushroom body circuit thus appears to support a general function for evaluating complex sensory patterns and deciding whether to approach or avoid.",

        "text": "Goal-directed decision making in biological systems is broadly based on associations between conditional and unconditional stimuli. This can be further classified as classical conditioning (correlation based learning) and operand conditioning (reward-based learning). A number of computational and experimental studies have well established the role of the basal ganglia (striatal system) towards reward-based learning, where as the cerebellum evidently plays an important role in developing specific conditioned responses. Although, they are viewed as distinct learning systems [1], recent animal experiments point towards their complementary role in behavioral learning, and also show the existence of substantial two-way communication between the two structures [2].  Based on this notion of co-operative learning, in this work we hypothesize that the basal ganglia and cerebellar learning systems work in parallel and compete with each other (Figure 1). We envision such an interaction being driven by a simple reward modulated heterosynaptic plasticity (RMHP) rule [3], in order to guide the over all goal-directed behavior. Using a recurrent neural network actor-critic model of the basal ganglia and feed-forward correlation learning model of the cerebellum (input correlation learning-ICO) [4], we demonstrate that the RMHP rule can effectively combine the outcomes of the two learning systems. This is tested using simulated environments of increasing complexity with a four-wheeled animat in a dynamic foraging task. Although, they are modeled within a highly simplified level of biological abstraction, we clearly demonstrate that such a combined learning mechanism, leads to much stabler and faster learning of goal-directed behaviors in comparison to the individual systems. \n",

        "text": "Animals have evolved diverse navigational strategies in order to survive in complex dynamic environments. Path integration (PI) is one of these strategies, which enables them to integrate angular and linear ego-motion cues to maintain a vector representation of their current location with respect to the starting point, called home vector. It has been observed in many animals ranging from arthropods to mammals. Especially social insects, such as ants and bees, exhibit astonishing capabilities in PI as part of their central place foraging [7].  PI plays a crucial role in acquiring spatial knowledge by providing a metric. In recent years, many neural models of PI have been proposed [3, 6]. However, only few of them have been applied on an actual physical robot [2, 4], and even fewer have discussed how PI mechanisms can be integrated in a neural architecture for complex navigation [1].\nWe present a neural PI mechanism interacting with neural locomotion control for homing behavior and associative goal learning in an autonomous hexapod walking robot. The mechanism is fed by inputs from an allothetic compass and an odometer. The home vector is computed and represented in circular arrays of neurons where heading angles are population-coded and linear displacements are rate-coded. Incoming signals are sustained through leaky neural integrator circuits and compute the home vector by local excitation-lateral inhibition interactions. An actor-critic reinforcement learning control [5] uses the computed home vector for state space exploration and associative learning of rewarding goal locations.\nUsing the angular difference between the heading and the home vector as feedback error for steering, we show that the PI mechanism can guide the robot back to its home position (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, vector representations of goals can be successfully learned by combining reward- and correlation-based learning methods [5].",

        "text": "The primate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex are major nodes in a brain network that supports short-term memory. While PFC has been shown to protect important memory content from distracting stimuli, parietal cortex is driven more strongly by sensory inputs, irrespective of their relevance to the current task. We compared extracellular single-unit activity from the PFC and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) of two rhesus monkeys trained to memorize and discriminate visually presented set sizes (numerosities). While performing the task, the animals had to resist a salient distractor numerosity that appeared during the memory delay. Surprisingly, PFC neurons preferentially encoded distractors during their presentation. Shortly after this interference, however, PFC neurons restored target information, which predicted correct behavioral decisions. In contrast, most VIP neurons only encoded target numerosities throughout the trial. Representation of target information in VIP was the earliest and most reliable neuronal correlate of behavior. Our results challenge the commonly held view that resistance to inference in PFC is the key mechanism for selection and maintenance of task-relevant stimuli in working memory. Instead, our data suggest that distracting stimuli can be bypassed by storing and retrieving target information, emphasizing active maintenance processes during working memory with complementary functions for frontal and parietal cortex in controlling memory content.",

        "text": "Studies focusing on the neural representation of hand forces have traditionally targeted the primary motor cortex (M1) due to its direct connections to the corticospinal tract. Few studies have also looked at premotor areas, where a stronger representation of movement planning is found. In this study we focused on the macaque ventral premotor cortex, also known as area F5, and on the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) because of their strong representation of grasping movements. \nWe trained a macaque monkey on a delayed grasping task, in which a manipulandum (handle) was grasped with the right hand with one of two grip types, either a power grip or a precision grip. Every grip had to be held for 1 second at one out of three force levels. Both the particular grip type and the required amount of force were cued to the monkey at the beginning of each trial. We then recorded neural activity from F5 and AIP in the left hemisphere, contralateral to the moving arm, with chronically implanted floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs; MicroProbes for Life Sciences). Two 32-channel FMAs were implanted in each area (total of 128 electrodes).\nWe found that single unit activity in F5 and AIP was strongly modulated by both grip type and grasping force. Response to grip type was similar in both areas. However, grasping force was more strongly coded in F5 than in AIP during most epochs of the task. Only during the cue presentation and the holding phase, when the monkey was actively maintaining the force level, similar proportions of AIP neurons showed force modulation as in F5. Neural modulation was also different in both areas, with F5 neurons showing more often an increase in activity with increased hand force, whereas AIP neurons were modulated to similar degree toward an increasing and decreasing force level.\nThese preliminary results demonstrate a clear, but potentially different involvement of AIP and F5 in the planning and execution of grasp forces.",

        "text": "Beta oscillations are often considered as pathological activity in Parkinson's disease and have also been implicated in motor suppression of healthy animals. However, recently we demonstrated that behavioral correlates of beta oscillations are more complex as, for example, beta power also increased in rats when sensory signals prompted them to quickly initiate movements [1]. To study the underlying neural mechanisms and the complex relation between beta oscillations and behavior, we combined computational modeling of basal ganglia networks with electrophysiological recordings from behaving rats. Previous computational models showed that increased inhibitory input from striatum to globus pallidus (GP) can generate pathological beta oscillations in the subthalamo-pallidal network [2]. To test whether the same model can also reproduce the experimentally-observed transient beta oscillations, we identified rat striatal medium-spiny neurons that increased their firing rate when the rat initiated movements. This striatal activity was then used as an estimate for inhibitory input to the GP in our network model. Indeed, we found that the movement-related increase in striatal activity leads to transient beta oscillations in the model with a time course that closely matches the experimentally measured oscillations (see Figure).  Furthermore, we studied the effect of additional excitatory input to the subthalamic nucleus in the model. It turns out that not only the amplitude, but also the relative timing of the inputs to GP and the subthalamic nucleus affect the amount of beta power in the model. We conclude that the striatal indirect pathway can drive transient beta oscillations during movement initiation and that transient beta oscillations in behaving animals share some of the underlying mechanisms with pathological beta oscillations in Parkinson's disease.",

        "text": "We considered a temporal sequence task performed by macaque monkeys where to match a stimulus with an appropriate movement[1] and rearranging the association is expected. We utilized Basal ganglia-Thalamus-Cortex(BTC) model to realize action selection and to select appropriate action, reinforcement learning rules are used to update BTC model parameters using temporal difference method. In [2,3], it is claimed that temporal difference method is biologically meaningful.  This working memory task is realized on humanoid robot, Darwin-Op on which online training is carried out.\nDuring task, robot learns to associate different stimulus with desired actions as summarized in figure. There are three different stimuli which are red, blue and yellow colours and three different actions. Robot recognizes the colours with the embedded camera and detected colour stimulus is the input of BTC model, where action selection is done. Robot is expected to decide on an action at first. Green colour is reward, and it is shown to robot if the selected action is the correct to be associated with the stimulus. At first, robot was expecting nothing and a given reward raises its expectation error. This urges robot to reinforce the desired stimulus-action pair. Once robot is rewarded due to a right choice, expectation error(ee) updates the parameters of BTC model in charge of action selection. When update is completed, robot manages to select the desired action to a given stimulus. In case, when an expected reward is not given to the selected action associated with a stimulus, this also causes an ee and urges robot to rearrange the previously built association between a stimulus and action. \nSo, robot manages to rearrange its associations by changing parameters of BTC model, which directly effects action selection and is biologically meaningful. As a future work, it is aimed to investigate the biological correlation between the parameters of BTC model and role of dopamine on action selection.",

        "text": "Recent technical advances in cell-type specific neuronal perturbation present the opportunity to systematically examine structure-function relationships in the brains of genetic model organisms. In the fruit fly, two prominent behaviors requiring sophisticated neuronal computation are visual object fixation and figure ground discrimination, yet the neural substrates remain unknown. Recent experiments in motion blind, walking flies revealed object responses due to a position system distinct from the T4-T5 cell dependent motion pathway [1]. We performed behavioral experiments in which we blocked synaptic output from T4-T5 cells and observed a lack of stripe fixation and figure ground discrimination at fast dynamics. Thus, for mediating these behaviors, the motion dependent system is necessary and the position system is insufficient.\nTo address the question of whether the T4-T5 motion system is sufficient to mediate such behaviors, we implemented two dynamical models based on measured properties of well-studied HS cells [2], immediate post-synaptic targets of T4-T5. The key component of both models is motion asymmetry in the responses of model neurons, whereby front-to-back motion elicits stronger responses than back-to-front motion. The first model is a simplified phenomenological model and the second is more physiologically realistic. Both couple a bilateral pair of neurons to turning behaviour. We show that these models are sufficient to mediate object tracking and figure ground discrimination in the presence of noise and predict fixation in front of moving backgrounds. Thus, we propose that already well understood neurons of the motion pathway, known to mediate wide field visuo-motor responses, are sufficient to allow flies to track small field objects under various conditions. It will be interesting to extend these modeling efforts with further anatomical, physiological and behavioral results to work towards a deeper understanding of fly visuo-motor behaviors.",

        "text": "Purkinje Cells of the cerebellar oculomotor vermis play an important role in the control of visually guided saccades. Despite a large variety of eye movement related firing rate changes of single cells, their population is able to explain the duration of the eye movement. Thus, most computational models of the neurons involved in the control of saccades use the spike density functions averaged over trials. In contrast, we created and compared three single trials models which predict the occurrence of individual spikes. The single units data contained 3x20 cells collected from each of the following structures in Rhesus macaques: Purkinje Cell (PC) Simple Spike units from the saccade-related cerebellar oculomotor vermis, caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN) neurons and abducens nucleus motoneurons (AN). We describe the discharge patterns of these units by spiking neuron models, comprised of a stochastic spike generator whose rate is controlled by a generalized linear model (GLM) with various regressors, including recent spiking history (Paninski 2004). The first model regresses onto eye X/Y positions with kernels drawn from Gaussian processes. The second model employs unimodal kernels, and adds speed and acceleration to the regressors to evaluate the dependence on these kinematical variables more explictly. The third model uses a biophysically plausible the eye plant model to regress on net forces computed from eye positions.\nThe well-described AN neurons (Prsa et al. 2010) served as a ground-truth for our method. All three computational models resulted in equally good predictions of the AN spikes. The models’ predictions for our data samples of  PC and cFN neurons were significantly worse than the ones for AN, but still well above a baseline computed from a model accounting only for the inter-trial variability, implying that a) GLM models can explain the task-related within-trial variability of these spiketrains and b) spikes relate to kinematical parameters via forces",

        "text": "Visual information processing is mediated not only by feedforward inputs but also profoundly modulated by feedback.  Whether cortico-thalamic feedback substantially changes the representation of visual information in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) remains an open question, as previous investigations have yielded inconsistent results. Here, we used the mouse model to test how cortico-thalamic feedback affects temporal and spatial processing of dLGN neurons. \nTo study the role of cortico-thalamic feedback we performed extracellular recordings with multisite linear silicon probes in dLGN of awake head-fixed mice. During recordings, we transiently silenced visual cortex by optogenetically stimulating parvalbumin–positive (PV+) inhibitory interneurons.\nTo assess feedback-related changes of temporal response properties, we first examined spontaneous activity. We found that during global inactivation of V1, spontaneous firing rates decreased abruptly. After 200 ms of cortical inactivation, dLGN neurons transitioned into burst mode firing, leading to a 3-fold increase in the burst-tonic firing ratio.\nTo assess feedback-related changes in spatial response properties, we measured size tuning in the dLGN by presenting gratings of different diameter. We found that numerous neurons in mouse dLGN exhibit surround suppression. Importantly, in dLGN neurons, transient inactivation of visual cortex led to an expansion of receptive field center size (22.3%) and a reduction of surround suppression (21.8%). We observed many dLGN neurons in which the decrease in surround suppression during cortical inactivation seems driven by two effects: a reduction of responses to stimuli up to the optimal size and an increase of responses to stimuli exceeding the optimal size.\nWe conclude that, similar to what has been reported for higher-order mammals, both temporal response properties and spatial integration in mouse dLGN are at least partly shaped by cortico-thalamic feedback circuits.",

        "text": "Bidirectional neuronal prosthetics would benefit tremendously if the writing in of neuronal information would be noninvasive. Conveniently, the superficial dendrites of projection neurons in superficial as well as infragranular layers should in principle allow for selective noninvasive optogenetic stimulation. To examine the feasibility of this approach we stimulated the dendritic tufts of layer V neurons with a sparse micro-movie of high temporal and spatial resolution in seven anesthetized Thy1-line18 mice. Simultaneously, we recorded extracellularly from of those neurons with dense multichannel electrodes. To quantify the transfer function from the sparse stimulation to the neuronal spiking we calculated spike triggered averages of the light stimulation pattern. Similar to the standard spike triggered averages of sensory receptive fields we found that a neuron has an area on the brain surface where it is sensitive to the light stimulation. The size of this area corresponded to the extent of the dendritic tuft of layer V neurons. Intriguingly, and to our great surprise, the size of this field changed over time until the spike was evoked. In general the field expanded over the last 20 ms before the spike was evoked. Moreover, the size of the field could be controlled by an early priming stimulation, indicating that the integrating field is not hard coded but can be changed dynamically. The expansion was seen in the presence of AMPA and NMDA antagonists suggesting a local mechanism. We speculate that the observed effect can be explained by a nonlinear dendritic mechanism possibly involving calcium and sodium dynamics. Our findings and technical set up provide directions for defining transfer functions for non-invasive “writing in” of complex spatiotemporal activity patterns in cortex for neuronal prosthetics.",

        "text": "In this study, we report that the injection of genetically engineered viral vectors in cat primary visual cortex (area 17) and a higher area (area 21a) can provide expression of channelrhodopsin and corresponding optogenetic control of neuronal activity. We used recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV2.1/5/9.CamKIIα.hChR2(H134R).eYFP) to transduce neurons in the visual cortex of three adult cats. The vector contained the channelrhodopsin-2 (hChR2) gene under the control of a CamKIIα promoter in order to target excitatory neurons, and was injected either into area 17 or area 21a. After 6-7 weeks, neuronal recordings were performed under isoflurane/sufentanil anesthesia using metal electrodes or multi-contact silicon probes. Optical stimulation with blue light (473 nm) was done by an optrode with 200 µm optical fiber or by surface illumination via a 2 mm optical fiber. Yellow light (593 nm) was used as a control. Surface and optrode stimulation both caused pronounced firing of the recorded multi-units in area 17 and 21a using the AAV2.1 and 2.9 vector. In area 17, spike latency in response to a 2 ms light pulse was 4.5 ms at a power density of 30 mW/mm2 and decreased with higher light intensities to 2.5 ms (60 mW/mm2). At the same time, firing rates increased with increasing light power, saturating around 70 mW/mm2. Spikes could be entrained to the stimulation frequency by both rectangular light pulses (at least up to 80Hz) and continuous wave stimulation. Transduction quality was confirmed by using confocal microscopy. With the AAV2.5 viral vector, we could not evoke any spiking or LFP activity nor could we identify fluorescence.\nIn summary, these results demonstrate that hChR2 expression in cat visual cortex mediated by rAAV2.1 or rAAV2.9 provides a promising tool for investigating neuronal processing and in particularly rhythmic activity in visual cortex.",

        "text": "With the advent of modern stimulation techniques in neuroscience, the opportunity arises to map neuron to neuron connectivity. In this work, we developed a method for efficiently inferring posterior distributions over synaptic strengths in neural microcircuits. The input to our algorithm is data from experiments in which action potentials from putative presynaptic neurons can be evoked while a subthreshold recording is made from a postsynaptic neuron. I will present a realistic statistical model which accounts for the main sources of variability in this experiment and allows for significant prior information about the connectivity and neuronal cell types to be incorporated if available. Due to the technical challenges and sparsity of these systems, it is important to focus experimental time stimulating neurons whose synaptic strength is most ambiguous, therefore we also developed an online optimal design algorithm for choosing which neurons to stimulate at each trial.",

The relative strength, their functional roles and their structure are subject to many theoretical and experimental studies. This is partly due to the difficulties of experimental access: For instance, it is unclear how networks of living cortical cells reacts to well defined spatially structured external inputs, how consistent their responses are and how their activity is modulated by an external drive. \n\nWe address this problem using a cell culture of optogenetically modified rat neurons. We consider this simple two dimension system as surrogate cortex as it resembles cortical tissue to some extend in structure, activity and development [1-3]. We then drive the neurons with spatially complex light patterns, generated by a holographic photostimulation system [4]. The neural responses are monitored with a multielectrode array. \n\nHere, we show a performance test of our setup, we show that cultured neurons react well to external stimuli and we present some preliminary results of modulations in network activity due to the external drive.",

        "text": "The aim of this work is to provide a global stability analysis for delayed neural field equations with any Lipschitz activation functions and arbitrary connection structures. \nNeural fields provide information of neural activity in time and space, by modeling the neuronal populations involved as a continuum. Delayed neural fields additionally take into account  the spreading of action potentials along the neural axons. A delayed neural field model of $n$ populations of $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ dimensions is given by \n$$ \\tau_i \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial t}(r, t) = -{U_i}(r, t) + \\int_{\\Omega} \\sum_{j=1}^n {W_{ij}}(r, r') S_j(U_j(r', t-d_{ij}(r,r')))dr' + {I}_i^{\\text{ext}},\\quad i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}, $$\nwhere $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb R^k$ is a bounded set over which the populations are distributed and, for each population, ${U_i(r,t)}$ represents the mean neuronal activity at position $r$ and at time $t$, $\\tau_i$ is a time constant, ${I}_i^{\\text{ext}}$ is the external input, $d_{ij}(r,r')$ is the time needed for the information of the population $j$ at location $r'$ to reach population $i$ at location $r$, ${W}_{ij}(r,r')$ describes the synaptic strength between location $r'$ in population $j$ and location $r$ in population $i$, and ${S}_j: \\mathbb{R}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the activation function of neural populations.\n\nSeveral works have addressed the stability of neural fields, [1, 2, 3].  In [3] the delayed neural field is linearized around an equilibrium and a local stability analysis is conducted using a Krasovskii-Lyapunov functional. We extend that work by relying on Razumikhin theorem to propose a sufficient condition, involving the Lipschitz constants of the activation functions, the axonal delays, and the synaptic strength, for the delayed neural fields model to have a unique equilibrium to which all solutions converge. Numerical simulations are also provided.",

In addition to the easy description of neurons, synapses and connectivity patterns [1] a parallel evaluation of large scale neural network models is particularly important. A number of research groups have focused on developing parallel algorithms and simulators best suited for the simulation of spiking neural models on CPUs but also on the upcoming GPUs, leading to several spiking simulation environments, e. g. Brian [2], NEST [3] or NeMo [4]. We present a neural simulator called ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Network architect) which targets the parallel evaluation of large scale rate-coded networks in addition to spiking neurons, through an explicit model description in Python similar to Brian. ANNarchy is capable of generating C++ and CUDA code allowing the parallel simulation of rate-coded, spiking and hybrid neural networks. Rate-coded and spiking implementations require different evaluation and underlying data structures to achieve an adequate speedup on the specific parallel hardware [5]. We show the suitability of our approach on CPUs and GPUs within our simulation environment at several examples, including randomly connected rate-coded and spiking networks. We show the parallel performance on GPUs and CPUs on more advanced models: a pulse-coupled spiking network and the bar learning problem.",

The neuro-simulator Brian proposes an equation-oriented description of neural variables allowing efficient code generation at runtime [4], but is limited to spiking point-neural networks. We present here the neuro-simulator ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) which uses a comparable model description mechanism for neuron and synapse models, but allows the simulation of rate-coded, spiking or even hybrid neural networks. Rate-coded neuron models can be described by a set of continuous ordinary differential equations (ODE) and parameters, while spiking point-neuron models can additionally define event-based updates after a spike is emitted. Synaptic transmission and plasticity follow a similar model. These equations are parsed and analysed using the Python library for symbolic mathematics Sympy, numerized using one of the backward, forward or exponential Euler methods and ultimately transformed into a platform specific code (either C++ code using OpenMP for CPUs or CUDA code for GPGPUs). The Python interface for network definition is mostly compliant with PyNN and allows to interface the network with external libraries (either in Python, C or C++) through Cython extension modules. ANNarchy is therefore particularly suited for building complex neural architectures and applying them to real-world problems such as neuro-robotics.",

        "text": "Fast oscillations of the population firing rate in the gamma range (50-200 Hz), where each individual neuron fires irregularly with a low rate, have been observed in networks of simulated leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons as well as in population signals in the living brain.\nAn analytical explanation of oscillatory population rates has been given in [1]. However a systematic approach identifying circuits responsible for specific oscillations in a potentially complicated structured network of populations of neurons is currently not available. Such a method would provide a tool for the identification of connections responsible for the emergence and propagation of oscillations in anatomically constrained networks and shed light on local dynamical mechanisms amplifying or suppressing certain frequencies . It could also be used to design a LIF-network with desired spectral features.\n\nIn this study we consider the spectra of population firing rates produced by networks with population specific connectivity. The populations are composed of randomly connected LIF-neurons. In our analysis we make use of the formalism developed in [2], who recently closed the gap between the descriptions of linear rate models and LIF-neurons. We derive an expression for the effective connectivity matrix which incorporates the anatomical (synaptic weights, in-degrees) as well as the dynamical properties [3] of the circuit. We are able to predict the spectra of the population firing rates for any connectivity pattern that allows for asynchronous activity. The analytically obtained predictions are validated by comparison with simulation results of a multi-layered cortical network model [4].\n\nDecomposing the effective connectivity matrix at a frequency where the spectrum shows a peak reveals the dominating eigenmode. By reconstructing the anatomical and dynamical contributions to this eigenmode we can narrow down the physical connections associated with the peak in the power spectrum.",

In the present study we investigate plastic feed-forward networks of nonlinear rate neurons with a correlation sensitive learning rule inspired by and being qualitatively similar to STDP. \nAfter obtaining equations that describe the change of the spatial shape of the signal from layer to layer  in adiabatic approximation, we derive a criterion for the non-linearity ensuring stable dynamics for arbitrary input: on one side of the critical border every perturbation decays, on the other activity explodes for sufficiently strong perturbations. On the border we analytically find stable self-reproducing solutions with a plateau of arbitrary width. Precise tuning of parameters is required for the existence of such synfire chains. Furthermore, sigmoidal nonlinearities naturally bring the system near to criticality.\nOn the subcritical side in the vicinity of the border long-living bump solutions still resemble the stable solutions on the border. The velocity of their  decay is independent of bump size  and increases with distance to criticality. Two bumps can unite if the interplay of diffusion and nonlinearity at the activity minimum overcomes the decay within their lifetime, otherwise they remain disjoint. For the united bump the same scenarios exist, so a kind of association tree can appear in this way.\n\nPartially supported by the Helmholtz Association: HASB and portfolio theme SMHB, the Jülich Aachen Research Alliance (JARA), HGF Nachwuchsgruppe VH-NG-1028, the Next-Generation Supercomputer Project of MEXT, and EU Grant 269921 (BrainScaleS).",

        "text": "A growing body of research reports the sequential activation of neural assemblies, suggesting that some brain computations are performed through sequence-based dynamics. A number of models have been proposed to explain this type of activation. Kremkow et al. (1) demonstrated that timing differences between correlated excitation and inhibition - temporal gating - can control the propagation of spiking activity transients. We adapted this mechanism in the following scenario. We simulated a recurrent balanced network of 20,000 conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons and embedded a chain of 3 to 20 gates exploiting the temporal gating principle. We found that this connectivity enables reliable feed-forward propagation and transient amplification along such a chain.\nHowever, in a recurrent network the synchronous activity in a chain can also excite the rest of the network, which then leads to instabilities such as persistent oscillatory activity. If the total excitation is weaker to compensate for such effects, the network elevates its activity during the signal propagation which is followed by the period of hyperpolarization of most of the neurons.\nWe next investigated the possible role of two mechanisms in stabilising network activity under these conditions. Spike Frequency Adaptation did not prevent the network from entering the oscillatory regime but allowed it to return to its normal state. Short-term plasticity in a form of synaptic depression allowed the network to remain in its stable state and shortened the hyperpolarization following chain activation. Next, we embedded multiple chains to test the robustness of this framework. If the chains are non-overlapping, the signal propagation is successful in all of the chains. When the chains share too many neurons, the signal gets disrupted and may lead to simultaneous activation of two or more chains. The next step is to find the conditions that allow for reliable signal propagation in such overlapping chains.",

NO provides homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability. Here we conduct a theoretical investigation of the distinguishing roles of NO-mediated diffusive homeostasis in comparison with canonical non-diffusive homeostasis in cortical networks. We find that both forms of homeostasis provide a robust mechanism for maintaining stable activity following perturbations. However, the resulting networks differ, with diffusive homeostasis maintaining substantial heterogeneity in activity levels of individual neurons, a feature disrupted in networks with non-diffusive homeostasis. This results in networks capable of representing input heterogeneity, and linearly responding over a broader range of inputs than those undergoing non-diffusive homeostasis. These results suggest a mechanism for dynamically maintaining neural heterogeneity, and expose computational advantages of non-local homeostatic processes. We currently investigate how these forms of homeostasis might interact with STDP during learning. Preliminary results suggest that diffusive homeostasis enables broader synaptic weight distributions and leads to networks which learn input patterns more effectively than those with non-diffusive homeostasis.",

Which synchronous patterns are favored by a recurrent network, thus, depends to a large degree on network structure. \n\tRecently, Pernice et al. were able to dissect the contribution of specific structural motifs in networks of arbitrary topology to pairwise correlations [3], based on a minimal model for networks of spiking neurons [2]. Unfortunately, the further generalization of this result to higher-order correlations (HOCs) has, until now, never been attempted. \n\tIn this work, we show that results pertaining to correlations of order 2 can be naturally extended to the case of HOCs. Building on the dynamical system approach of Pernice et al. , we obtain intuitive decomposition formulas, in which cumulants [4] of neuronal spiking activity are seen as weighted sums of network motifs, responsible for their generation. The structures relevant to the emergence of HOCs turn out to be all subtrees of the given network graph, connecting neurons amongst which higher-order interactions have been observed.\n\tOur results represent a suitable starting point to develop efficient methods for neuronal data analysis, as they reduce the problem of computation of HOCs to one of enumerating all network substructures, capable of generating them. However, as the number of such relevant motifs grows supra-exponentially with correlation order, we also develop a pseudo-algorithm, capable of dealing with this combinatorial problem.",

        "text": "Neuronal variability constrains  computation and coding, both at the single-cell and circuit level. Such limitations are particularly severe when spike counts within behaviorally relevant time intervals are so low that discretization becomes an issue. For example, grid cells in rat medial entorhinal cortex discharge on average with only 2.0Hz ±1.3Hz (std)), and even the mean maximum firing rate within one of the hexagonally arranged grid field is just 9.7Hz ± 5.3Hz (std), or one spike per theta cycle, the dominant oscillatory component of the local field potential. Notably, grid cells have Fano factors larger than unity (super-Poisson) [1]. In addition, the trial-to-trial fluctuations of spike counts, relative to the values predicted from mean-firing-rate maps, are correlated across grid cells. These noise correlations depend on the spatial overlap of the cell's’ tuning curves [2,3].\n\nUsing data from Sargolini et al (2006) [4], we estimate grid-cell firing rates along an animal’s spatial trajectory. These firing rates form the basis of a stochastic model based on inhomogeneous Poisson processes. For Poisson processes without co-modulations, the noise correlations are expected to scatter around zero, but as in [2,3] we observe significant deviations from this prediction. To capture these correlations, we co-modulate the firing rates in a time-dependent fashion. To this end, we take into account that throughout the hippocampal complex, local field potentials exhibit oscillations in the theta frequency band (6-10 Hz). We study the influence of the simultaneously recorded theta signal on the noise correlations and let the modulations in different cells have shifted phases. The match between model and real data suggests a coupling between theta modulations, spatial-grid phase, and noise correlations. This result has implications for the spatial precision of population codes and for models that describe the formation of spatially modulated neuronal discharge.",

Grid cells are activated whenever the animal is close to a vertex of an imaginary hexagonal lattice spanning the environment [1]. Within each of these firing fields, the spike phases of a grid cell, relative to the theta-band local field potential, tend to occur at successively earlier phases [2]. This phenomenon has been termed “phase precession”. \nRecent studies suggest that phase precession carries spatial information at the single-trial level. This has been shown for rats running back and forth on linear tracks [3] as well as moving freely in two-dimensional environments [4]. We therefore asked whether spike phase or phase-precession can be directly used for path integration. Analyzing single-run data, we find no evidence that the position of the animal is mapped one-to-one onto spike phase. But we do find non-trivial effects if we compare the amount of phase precession along paths through a firing field that intersect twice or multiple times. We discuss these results with respect to their relevance for path integration.\n",

        "text": "Recent experimental findings suggest that plasticity mechanisms of long-term depression involve selective elimination of weak synapses and retaining of strong synapses[1], implying a reorganization of network topology rather than just adjustment of connection weights. Here we present a simple model that explores network topology changes resulting from two different plasticity rules. \nNetworks of excitable neurons were modeled with deterministic excitable nodes involving discrete susceptible, exited and refractory states (SER model), where susceptible nodes nodes became excited by excited linked neighbors. Neurons were connected into random networks with varying numbers of nodes (up to 279) and different density of links (varying from 25% to 75% of fully connected). Simulations were randomly initialized with 10% of excited nodes and equal assignment of susceptible and refractory nodes. After fixed intervals, a Hebbian or Spike time-dependent (STD) like plasticity rule was applied, based on the simultaneous or sequential coactivation matrix of the network, respectively. Specifically, the probability of pruning links was proportional to the normalized (simultaneous or sequential) coactivation of linked nodes.  After application of the pruning rules, the same number of pruned connections could be returned to the network in random uniform or local fashion.\nSimulations with the Hebbian like plasticity rule shaped initially random networks into modular  networks, with an associated limited range of sustained network activity. By contrast, simulations with the STD like plasticity rule resulted in hub networks, with a clear segregation on in the degree distribution between averagely connected nodes and a small number of highly connected hub nodes. The latter networks displayed a wide dynamic range.\nThus,  despite the relative simplicity of the dynamic model, the two plasticity rules produced networks with  distinctive topological features of modules and hubs that are widely found in biological neural networks.",

        "text": "One distinctive feature of Purkinje cells is that they have two types of discharge: in addition to simple spikes they fire complex spikes in response to input from the climbing fibers. These complex spikes have an initial rapid burst of spikes and spikelets followed by a sustained depolarization; in some models of cerebellar function this climbing fiber input supervises learning in Purkinje cells. On the other hand, synaptic plasticity is often thought to rely on the timing of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spikes. It is suggested here that the period of depolarization following a complex spike, combined with a simple spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule, gives a mechanism for the climbing fiber to supervise learning in the Purkinje cell. This proposal is illustrated using a simple simulation in which it is seen that the climbing fiber succeeds in supervising the learning.\n",

        "text": "Multielectrode arrays (MEAs) are an excellent tool to record neuronal cell networks derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-NN) (1,2). In silico modeling of such neuronal networks will enhance our understanding of neuronal systems and their development. In the past, we have built a phenomenological model called INEX (INhibitory-EXcitatory) that was used to simulate developing hPSC-NNs on MEAs. In this paper, we propose a simulation of mature hPSC-NNs by modifying our INEX model to simulate their activity. We focus on synchronous bursts which are a main feature of mature neuronal activity patterns. The INEX model is based on inhomogeneous Poisson processes to simulate spontaneously active neurons (3). Each simulated neuron has either an inhibitory or an excitatory effect to its postsynaptic neurons. The parameter types are chosen in such a way that the resulting spike trains resemble spike trains of in vitro MEA experiments with hPSC-NNs with respect to spike and burst rate. A network with 1,000 neurons and 10 per cent connectivity was simulated. \nFor validation, we examined MEA recordings from 9 relatively mature hPSC-NNs performed for approximately 300 seconds 27 to 39 days after plating. We calculated the median and quartiles of the spike and burst rate, the number of spikes per burst and the burst duration using the burst analysis tool by Kapucu et al. (4) for both the simulated and the experimental data. Moreover, we used the detection method of synchronous burst events published by Raichmann and Ben-Jacob (5). The results showed that we can simulate typical spike and burst patterns as known from MEA experiments with mature hPSC-NNs and in particular synchronous bursts. The validation showed that all calculated median values of the INEX data are within the lower and upper quartile of the MEA data. To conclude, the calculated features adapted from spikes and bursts show that matured hPSC-NNs as observed in MEA experiments can be modeled by the INEX model.",

        "text": "Functional MRI (fMRI) of the ongoing brain activity at rest, i.e., without any overt-directed behavior, has revealed patterns of coherent activity, so called resting-state functional networks. Dynamical organization of nodes into these functional networks is closely related to the underlying structural connections. However, functional correlations have also been observed between cortical regions without apparent neural links, and mechanisms generating functional connectivity between distant cortical regions are largely unknown. It has been suggested that indirect connections and collective effects governed by the network properties of the cortex play a significant role. \n\nWe use a modeling approach in conjunction with experimental data to \nstudy dynamical aspects of functional connectivity in the human brain. Based on numerical simulations, we investigate the underlying mechanisms with reference to remote synchronization and network symmetry. At first, we demonstrate how the coupling topology is extracted. Our procedure is based on connectivity maps derived from fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging experiments, combining both functional and structural connectivity. Consequently, our network model includes the important information whether direct or indirect neural connections exist between functionally associated regions. \n\nNeural activity and inferred hemodynamic response of the network nodes are modeled as self-sustained oscillators embedded in topologies of complex functional brain interactions. In the simulated functional networks, we find that remote synchrony between pairs of nodes arises from symmetry in the interactions, which are quantified by the number of shared neighbors. An increasing size of a joint neighborhood positively correlates with a higher level of synchrony. Therefore, our results indicate that a large overlapping neighborhood in complex networks of brain interactions gives rise to functional similarity between distant cortical regions.",

In particular, we observed that the synaptic plasticity rules allow a fraction of the excitatory cells to become driver neurons that form strong excitatory synapses to their postsynaptic targets. Driver cells in our model act as leader neurons, a concept that attained substantial experimental interest in the last years [Eckmann2008, Pasquale2013].\n\nWe present here an detailed analysis of this phenomenon and show that a delicate interplay of the different forms of synaptic plasticity leads to the observed effects of self-organization. We separated influences from different sourses in a set of simplified models that serve as a mean-field approximation to the particular aspects of the network dynamics. By studying their properties we gain a deeper understanding of the derived phenomena and are able to support our simulation results by analytical arguments.",

        "text": "The auditory brainstem of the barn owl, and in particular the coincidence detection circuit in nucleus laminaris, provides an exceptional model system to study the emergence of extracellular electrical potentials. The stereotyped spatial arrangement of axons and neurons and the well known input of the nucleus laminaris facilitate a quantitative understanding of the origins of evoked potentials. We take advantage of these properties in modelling extracellular potentials due to synaptic and axonal currents, and we compare the model to electrophysiological data.\n\nWe present a minimal model of one-dimensional axon bundles that affords analytical treatment, and a biophysical model that is able to incorporate more details such as the axonal nodes of Ranvier and current kinetics. On the basis of these models, we are able to understand several previously unexplained aspects of the evoked potentials: the spatio-temporal structure of the responses to transients, which is due to the arrangement of bifurcations and terminations in the axon bundles, and the signatures of synaptic adaptation. \n\nTo test the computational models, we analysed extracellular electrophysiological recordings of the responses to auditory stimuli in anaesthetised owls, in normal condition and during iontophoretic application of synaptic blockers. Adaptation is revealed by the comparison of these control and synaptic blocker conditions, and the observed adaptation matches the behaviour of the biophysical model. Here, the system provides a rare opportunity to study the dynamics of synaptic adaptation in vivo.\n\nThe results presented here can be used to understand the nature of noninvasively measured potentials such as the auditory brainstem response. Furthermore, they can help elucidate the role that active currents play in the generation of field potentials observed in other brain regions, which were previously thought to be largely passive in origin.",

        "text": "Calcium imaging techniques have been used to monitor the dynamic activity of both individual neurons and assemblies of neurons.  With these techniques the accurate reconstruction of action potentials (APs) from fluorescence signals is restricted because of noise, the low temporal resolution of these signals, as well as by an indirect nonlinear relationship between intracellular calcium transients and the membrane potential. Therefore, several approaches for AP reconstruction from calcium imaging data have been introduced, for example template matching [1], deconvolution [2], and  sequential Monte Carlo methods [3]. \n\nIn the present work, we propose to apply Bayesian inference to well-established biophysical models thereby inferring the underlying neuronal activity so that APs can be detected. This method adopts a generative model, including evolution (spiking model) and observation (fluorescence-calcium mapping) equations so that the neuronal membrane potential and calcium kinetics are connected to fluorescence signal generation. This generative model is inverted using variational Bayes [4] to infer the biophysical parameters of the neuron, such as membrane potential (thus, APs), and calcium transients. The framework can adopt models of different complexity, for example Hodgkin–Huxley model [5], burst firing models [6], novel non-hybrid leaky integrate and fire models and phenomenological models. We propose to identify the best model to explain calcium imaging data using Bayesian model comparison [4]. We applied and validated the framework on both simulated and real data from the CA3 area of hippocampal slices.\n\nIn conclusion, the new technique enables the parameter optimization of biophysically plausible models and Bayesian model comparison using calcium imaging data. This is not only useful for reconstructing APs but may also be used to infer parameter changes, e.g. due to a pharmacological intervention.",

        "text": "Studies carried out on human subjects during upright standing hypothesized that RI may be a better source of feedback control since the Tibialis Anterior (TA) proprioceptive activity is unmodulated by the homonymous muscle activation during postural sway [1]. Here, the role of RI on human postural control was investigated by computer simulations performed on a biologically based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal model. Mathematical models were used to represent the fundamental neuromechanical elements of the postural control system (see Figure 1), such as: i) spinal MNs and INs associated to the motor nuclei of the Triceps Surae and TA muscles [2]; ii) musculotendon units; iii) muscle receptors; iv) sensory fibers; and v) an inverted pendulum that represents the human body during upright standing. Two model structures (Model 1 – without RI; Model 2 – with RI) were used to evaluate the role of the RI pathway on postural control. Time- and frequency-domain metrics associated to the postural sway were calculated from the simulations to validate the model outcomes with respect to the experimental data from the literature [3]. Additionally, cross-correlation analysis was performed between muscle fiber lengths and center of mass (COM) displacements. Simulation results showed that both models reproduced the postural control metrics frequently observed from vestibular-loss subjects standing on a stable surface without visual feedback. For the Soleus muscle, cross-correlation analyses showed a predominance of “paradoxical” behavior (negative length-COM correlation) for the Model 2, whereas Model 1 exhibited a predominant “orthodox” behavior. Gastrocnemii and TA muscles always exhibited an “orthodox” behavior. These results reinforce the view that “paradoxical” muscle fibre behavior may be influenced by RI [1]. Nonetheless, even in the absence of RI (such as in some neurological disorders) the posture control may be achieved through the autogenic feedback pathways.",

        "text": "The random-dot-motion (RDM) task, which tests motion signal perception in noise, has proved extremely useful in the study of sensory decision-making. Neuronal recordings in monkeys have revealed how motion-direction information is accumulated between stimulus onset and a monkey’s decision and inspired much recent work on applying stochastic diffusion models to decision-making. However, a non-invasive and easily-measured variable that reflects the dynamics of decision-making in humans at a fine temporal scale remains to be found. . Here, we evaluate whether slow eye movements (SEMs) in humans viewing a RDM pattern are correlated with their ongoing decision-making process, inspired by the known parallels between motion perception and SEMs (like smooth pursuit). Human subjects viewed a low-coherence RDM pattern containing signal dots moving to the left or right and indicated their decision about motion direction using either a keyboard press (Experiment 1), a horizontal saccade (Experiment 2) or a vertical saccade (Experiment 3). Independent of response modality, their eyes slowly moved (“drifted”) on average in the direction of the impending decision in all three experiments. Trials with SEMs were associated with better performance. The average SEMs on error trials indicated the direction of the subject’s incorrect response, rather than the direction of the coherently moving dots. SEMs in the direction of the subjects’ response were also found in trials using zero-coherence stimuli. SEMs appear to show a pattern similar to that of the neural activity of single neurons in monkey parietal cortex reported in the literature. SEMs may thus provide a non-invasive window into decision-making and allow the testing of motion-processing models with high temporal resolution and on a trial-by-trial basis.",

        "text": "Unsupervised learning in neuronal networks involves various mechanisms of neuromodulation. In particular, extrasynaptic level of dopamine (DA) may play a critical role in long-term changes of synaptic strength. In modeling spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule modulated by DA has been proposed to resolve the distal reward problem (Izhikevich, 2007). Using the single synapse model has explained several network level phenomena of reinforcement learning, i.e. classical and instrumental conditioning, shifting the DA increase from response to unconditioned to conditioned stimuli (Izhikevich, 2007) and increase the firing rate of an arbitrarily chosen neuron (Legenstein, Pecevski, & Maass, 2008). Following those results we presented a model of network level learning based on reward dependent changes of synaptic efficacies. The model is proposed in the form of a recurrent network of spiking neurons randomly connected by DA-modulated STDP plasticity synapses. \nKey properties of network-level learning associated with DA-modulated STDP rules were formulated and examined using computer simulations. Changes of synaptic efficacies in the whole network during the reinforcement learning procedure were studied. The learning mechanisms were illustrated using an example of the network solving a particular task. In this simple example the reward dependent synaptic changes occurred when the chosen neuronal group was activated in a pre-defined spatial order. Stability of the reinforced synapses and interplay between the new reinforced groups of neurons and the existed ones were investigated. The informational capacity of the network as the maximal numbers of co-existing non-interfering neuronal groups was estimated depending on the plasticity parameters and the network properties.",

        "text": "Globus pallidus externa (GPe) is proposed to mediate the NoGo pathway in Basal Ganglia (BG). Until recently, GPe was considered to be a homogeneous network but recent experimental data shows that GPe is composed of two sub-populations expressing either parvalbumin (GPe-TI) or preproenkephalin (GPe-TA). Interestingly, GPe-TA neurons fire in-phase with Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) neurons during cortical slow wave activity (SWA) and target upstream (striatum) while GPe-TI neurons fire in anti-phase with STN neurons and target downstream BG nuclei, (STN and GPi) [1]. Here, we studied the consequences of this dichotomy using a mean field model of BG. The unknown network parameters were fitted by tuning the mean field model to reproduce the results in [4]. Recently a mean field model has been used to make predictions about effective connectivity of GPe-TA ,TI and STN network [5]. However, in this work, inconsistent with the data, pallidostriatal back projections were ignored. Here, we show that including striatum introduces more parameter regimes that can fit [4]. We also confirm our findings in a spiking network model of BG [3].\n\nOur results provide many insights. Firstly, we found that multiple parameter combinations could replicate the results in [4]. This implies, that there are multiple mechanisms to manifest a pathological state of the BG network and can explain the limited efficacy of therapeutic measures in alleviating the disease related symptoms. Secondly, we provide predictions about effective connectivity to/from GPe sub-populations to other BG nuclei including striatum, for example, (1) striatal input to GPe-TI should be much stronger than to GPe-TA (2) GPe-TI is the more dominant projection among GPeTA-TI interactions etc.\nLastly, our model suggests that dichotomy in the two GPe sub-populations plays an integral role in maintaining their anti-phase relationship during SWA, segregating the two sub-populations as separate functional pathways.",

        "text": "Characterization of the dynamics of purely inhibitory network is crucial for understanding the computations performed by brain areas such as the striatum, globus pallidus and central amygdala. Previously, networks of inhibitory neurons have been studied for their oscillatory dynamics [1], winner-take-all (WTA) properties [2], traveling waves [3], etc. Recently, network simulations [4] and experimental data [5-7] suggest that purely inhibitory networks could also support transient neuronal assemblies.\n\nHere, we investigated the effect of spatial connectivity structure on the emergence and maintenance of spatially clustered activity in large-scale inhibitory networks of 10,000 leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) model neurons. We considered two different types of spatial connectivity structures in which the connection probability decreased as a function of distance, according to (1) a Gaussian and (2) a Gamma distribution.\n\nIn networks with Gaussian connectivity, the activity remained asynchronous irregular (AI), independent of the external input. However, in networks with Gamma function type spatial connectivity (gamma-nets), the activity dynamics changed qualitatively, depending on the input strength: weak external input induced AI activity; mid-range input organized the activity into unstable spatial clusters,  resembling the experimentally observed neuronal assemblies and winner-less-competition (WLC) [8]; and stronger external input induced stable WTA type dynamics. \n\nNext, we studied the effect of external stimuli on the spatial structure of ongoing activity in gamma-nets. We found that in the WTA state only very strong inputs could alter the structure of the network activity. By contrast, in the AI and WLC regimes, network dynamics were flexible and could be used for stimulus encoding. Finally, we discuss the implications of these different dynamics and their stimulus interactions for the function and dysfunction of the striatum.",

        "text": "The cerebellum is an important node of the neural network hosting inverse and forward internal models to generate the required motor commands for a desired movement and to predict sensory consequences of the applied motor commands, respectively. Therefore, cerebellar damage is associated with disability to adapt internal models, leading to deficient motor performance against perturbations. However, in recent studies, cerebellar patients showed some adaptation to gradually applied perturbations in reaching tasks. This residual motor learning ability has been linked to the remaining capacity of the central nervous system to learn the inverse model dynamics. Recently, we also showed that the cerebellar ataxia patients can re-optimize head movement kinematics during large gaze shifts when the head moment of inertia is 3.3 fold increased [1]. However, it is not clear whether and to what extent the residual optimizing ability is dependent on the adaptation of inverse or forward models of the head dynamics. Here, we present a control systems model on the head movements in order to identify the necessary mechanisms to be updated following altered effector dynamics, i.e. increased head inertia. With the model, we assessed the contributions of internal models on movement kinematics during large gaze shifts in 9 cerebellar ataxia patients and 10 healthy subjects. We found that, without updating the forward model, it is still possible to improve the head movement kinematics optimally. Specifically, by updating the inverse model, the system can decrease head oscillations, maintain optimal movement durations, and increase peak velocity towards the new optimum over the course of the trials with increased inertia, just as in our cerebellar subjects. These suggest that the extra-cerebellar motor control network can still implement the inverse models and re-optimize the desired trajectory based on the up-to-date inverse model even without a correctly adapted forward model.",

A recently published modification promises wider applicability of these methods with better time resolution and same accuracy by using Bayesian inference and knowledge propagation. We investigate the capability and limitations of this new framework. Its performance is compared to well-established least square methods at the example of well-known linear and non-linear, structurally identical or dififferent model systems. We point out that care should be taken when interpreting obtained results, as inferred information about coupling directionality and strength are misleading if the investigated dynamics are not adequately approximated by phase based methods. Tracking of time-varying coupling parameters requires a limitation of knowledge propagation. We present an improved method for the time-resolved inference of interaction properties, which obtains comparable or better accuracy without sensitive dependance upon the choice of an internal parameter of the inference algorithm as the original algorithm. We apply this new method to intracranial, multichannel EEG recordings from epilepsy patients and present time-evolving interaction properties of different communicating brain areas, which allows tracking of the dynamics of epileptic brain networks at a priorly not accessible time resolution.",

Here, we report on data recorded in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields of Mongolian gerbils in virtual reality (VR). Using a VR, we can study the impact of visual cues on place cells independent of self-motion cues. In both, real and virtual environments, we find hippocampal place cells that encode specific locations by their place fields. When the animal moves through such a place field, place cell spikes precess relative to hippocampal theta oscillations (phase precession). As in rats and mice, the local field potential (LFP) of Mongolian Gerbils has high power in the theta range (4-12 Hz). In virtual reality however we find that theta frequency reduces in comparison to theta recorded in real environments. During periods of immobility or slow wave sleep (SWS), place cells are taking part in population bursts that are temporally correlated to sharp wave-ripple (SWR) complexes. Our results show that firing patterns of hippocampal place cells in VR are largely similar to those in real environments.",

Specifically, we report that parametrically increasing the noise level results in increased spike train synchronization.\nWe also explore how well the spike train in response to this stimulus can be captured by an exponential integrate-and-fire neuron [2], a simple model that has been successfully applied for reproducing spike times of pyramidal cells under noisy current stimulation in vitro [3].\nIn contrast to the in vitro situation, our model also includes an appreciable amount of intrinsic noise, accounting for fluctuating input from the surrounding network.",

We model these so called UP/DOWN states in an analytically tractable framework as dichotomous noise, a stochastic process that jumps between two states. This work studies the spike train statistics of a perfect integrate-and-fire neuron receiving such an input. Unlike previous studies, we consider asymmetric dichotomous noise with two different transition rates.  We derive the interspike interval distribution and serial correlation coefficient by solving a first-passage-time problem and check the analytical results by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we get approximations for a generalized model framework including additional weak leakage as well as additive white noise. The results may help to understand the influence of correlations in presynaptic signals on neuronal firing.",

        "text": "Firing patterns in cortical networks are often modeled by assuming Poissonian input spike trains. Imposing self-consistency at the level of firing rates (input rate of driving cells = output rate of driven cell) then yields an analytical description of network dynamics (see e.g. Brunel J. Comp. Neurosci. 2000). However, output spike trains are usually non-Poissonian, something a more coherent framework should account for. Here we present two iterative procedures that only employ repeated simulations of a single neuron and yield, over a sufficient number of generations of the procedure, the self-consistent statistics at the level of spike-train auto-correlations.\n\nIn the renewal approximation, presynaptic action potentials have the same interspike-interval distribution as output spike trains from the previous generation. In the Gaussian approximation, the synaptic input of a neuron is given by the mean and fluctuations of the previous generation. Both procedures are carried out until the power spectrum of the output spike train does not change anymore. We test both approximations by comparing the  resulting stationary spectra from the procedures to those obtained in simulations of a large sparse recurrent network of LIF neurons. Our results show that a self-consistent determination of the temporal structure of spike trains is possible for a recurrent network poised close to the balanced state.",

        "text": "Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) declines during aging and is absent beyond postnatal day (PD) 110 when mice are raised in standard cages (SC)(1). In contrast, raising mice in an enriched environment (EE) preserved a juvenile-like OD plasticity into late adulthood(2). EE-raising provides the mice with more social interactions (larger groups), more voluntary physical exercise (running wheels) and more cognitive stimulation (regularly changed labyrinths) compared to SCs, raising the question whether all components are needed or whether one of them is already sufficient to prolong plasticity. To test whether voluntary physical exercise alone prolongs OD-plasticity, we raised mice from 7 days before birth in slightly larger than normal SCs (27x43x19cm) with or without a running wheel (RW) and visualized V1-activities in adulthood (>PD135) before and after monocular deprivation (MD) using intrinsic signal optical imaging. RW-raised mice continued to show an OD-shift towards the open eye after 7 days of MD into adulthood (age range: PD135-260): the ODI decreased from 0.26±0.03 without MD to 0.05±0.03 after MD (t-test; p<0.01), while SC-mice without a RW did not show OD-plasticity (noMD: 0.32±0.02, MD: 0.25±0.03; t-test; p>0.05). In addition, the OD-shift of RW-mice was mediated by a decrease of deprived eye responses in V1, which was previously seen only in 4-week-old SC-raised mice(3), or in adult EE-mice(2). We thus conclude that voluntary physical exercise alone can extend the sensitive phase for OD-plasticity in mouse V1 into late adulthood.\n\n(1)Lehmann & Löwel (2008) PLoSONE 3(9):e3120, (2)Greifzu et al.

        "text": "In an excitatory presynapse, the signal transductions are executed by a complex cytomatrix of functionally streamlined proteins in the active zones. The inception of assembly of these molecules mark the genesis of the presynapse. Though investigations have provided insights about the various attributes of these molecules, there is still a need for a model which holistically integrates their pathways. In this work, we have devised a petri-net based framework to trace the morphological changes of the presynapse during different stages of genesis and development in 2D. We have envisaged feedback mechanisms involving the signaling cascades of the neurotransmitter wastage factor and retrograde signaling cues based on the activity and presynaptic release probability. The crux of our model is to interleave the feedback cascades, mechanisms of the active zones (endocytosis, exocytosis, vesicle re-uptake and refilling) and CAM with the actin cytoskeleton based morphological changes thereby linking structure with function. We have formulated the exocytosis model based on the “SNARE hypothesis” and have assumed that Clathrin and membrane and vesicular proteins mediate the endocytosis in a scenario well-endowed in vesicles. VMAT and H+-Glutamate transporter regulates the endosomal refilling process based on the proton gradient caused by the V-ATPase. Cannabinoid receptor's “lock and key” mechanism and activity dependent stimulation of cAMP pathway by autoreceptors are incorporated in the feedback mechanisms. We have attempted to model the actin-vesicle dynamics by coupling the Profilin, Cofilin, Arp2/3 and Gelsolin based Actin treadmilling process with Synapsin based control of readily releasable pools. Parameters like localization and distribution of CAM's which play critical role in morphogenesis of presynapse were also analysed as a part of our study. The synergic and fictile relationship between the pre and postsynapses is one that requires further study.",

        "text": "The ability to recognize previously visited places is determined by the sensory information available at a place and possibly context from neighboring places. Waller, Loomis, Golledge and Beall (2002) showed that for places enclosed by a landmark configuration, where gaze shifts are required to perceive the entire surround, distance information is preferred over direction information. Only if all directions to landmarks at the goal location are orthogonal to each other, participants preferred the angles between landmarks as a cue. Still the role of landmark distance for place encoding remains unclear. The present study focuses on the influence of distance information by measuring position judgments for goals with different landmark configurations. \nOne group of participants navigated in a configuration of four landmarks which build up a parallelogram and another group was tested in a non-regular quadrilateral configuration. In a virtual environment participants were asked to navigate on a plus-shaped bridge crossing a pond starting from all compass directions. In the learning phase each trial involved a 90 degree turn at the center of the bridge which was thus learned incidentally. In the test phase the whole environment was covered by ground fog. Participants were asked to recognize the crossing point via the four outstanding landmarks.\nThe results showed that the non-regular quadrilateral group was significantly biased from the crossing point and the error ellipse was elongated towards landmarks further away from the crossing point. In contrast the average decision points per participant in the parallelogram group were not significantly biased. Still, the error ellipse was again elongated towards more distant landmarks.\nWe conclude that the relative distances of the set of landmarks available at the goal location is relevant for place encoding. This may be related to the decreasing reliability of depth estimates for more distant landmarks.\n",

        "text": "There is enormous interest in creating autonomous walking robots that can efficiently navigate in complex environment. Up to date  such robots can perform a variety of complex behaviors including walking over rough terrain due to elaborate programming. However most of them still fail to handle or walk around in an environment with multiple obstacles. Existing approaches include reactive control like Braitenberg control [1] and minimal recurrent control (MRC) networks [2,3,4]. Typically, the MRC outperforms Braitenberg control but fails when facing complicated environments [2]. This is because it functions as reactive obstacle avoidance behavior control. According to this, in this work we extend the MRC with a synaptic plasticity rule (see Figure 1a).\nThe main difference between artificial agents and biological creatures has been so far adaptability and here we see the key point for better behavior control for our agent (see Figure 1b, 1c). Therefore we decide to use an adaptive synaptic scaling algorithm proposed by Tetzlaff et al. [5] as the plasticity rule, in order to solve also complex environments. This rule provides adaptivity and stability to the controller. \nDifferent variants of synaptic plasticity are evaluated, as well as environments with different levels of complexity. When applying the synaptic plasticity rule properly to the MRC, the obstacle avoidance mechanism becomes very robust and enables the robot to navigate in a very complex environment (see Figure 1d). Some of the evaluated environments are difficult enough and can be seen as realistic models of real environments. An example of the MRCs performance in a complex environment is given in Figure 1d. From the starting position (0,-1) the robot starts to avoid the obstacles in front of it and explores also the environment. Even the enclosure at (2,-2) is no problem for the algorithm and AMOSII escapes quickly.\n",

        "text": "Reservoir computing refers to a class of recurrent neural network models, like Echo State Networks [1] and Liquid State Machines [2], which consist of an input layer, a large reservoir layer with random recurrent connections and a layer of trainable readout units, that is capable of performing nonlinear memory dependent computations. Given a sufficiently large reservoir or liquid computing network, these models possess universal computational powers [2] with the ability to approximate any nonlinear function. In principle, large reservoirs have the benefit of being very versatile in application as they are not specialized to a specific task. However, the downside of big, task independent networks is that they comprise a lot of units with relatively small influence on the readout, along with a high training complexity. By relinquishing the versatility of the network, task specificity can be exploited for much smaller networks. Previous work has shown that for a given problem small, manually created, non-random networks can reach the same performance as normal sized random networks [3]. Instead of creating problem specific networks from scratch, which can take a lot of time, this work presents a way of adapting random recurrent networks to a given task by reducing it to the most important subset of units.\nThis simple, information theoretic based algorithm for network pruning incrementally deletes the unit, which shares the least mutual information with the readout units. Using a rate coded neuron model, the algorithm was tested with different initial network topologies, including poisson random graphs, scale-free networks and small-world networks. The tasks, these networks were adapted to, ranged from purely memory dependent to purely nonlinear problems. Not only could the network size dramatically be reduced without impairing the performance, but also did the performance on nonlinear tasks improve after pruning.",

        "text": "An integrative view of neural circuits and mechanical components has been developed by neuroscientists and biomechanical scientists [1]. This view argues that mechanical components (e.g., muscles) cannot be isolated from neural circuits in the context of substantially perturbed locomotion [2, 3]. Based on these findings, we developed a neuromechanical controller [4] consisting of a modular neural network (MNN) and virtual agonist-antagonist muscle mechanisms (VAAMs). The MNN basically forms complex sensorimotor coordination while the VAAMs generate variable compliant leg motions of a hexapod robot. Specifically, the compliant leg motions are achieved by only changing the stiffness parameters of the VAAMs without any passive mechanisms or torque and position feedback [5, 6]. The neuromechanical control can be modelled as a set of distributed and closed loops with feedforward and feedback pathways (see Figure. 1). For feedforward pathways, the controller consists of feedfoward control via descending commands (i.e.,$S$, $N_{i}$, and $O_{i}$) from a neural circuit to muscle-like mechanisms and body mechanics. In feedback pathway, there is force sensing (i.e., $F_{j}$ ) at the end effectors of the legs. In the controller, the MNN (see Figure. 1 (a)) generates signals for inter- and intra-leg coordinations of the hexapod robot. The virtual agonist-antagonist mechanisms (VAAMs) (see Figure. 1 (b)) are developed for simulating muscle-like behaviors (e.g., variable compliant leg motions). Specifically, each joint of the hexapod robot is driven by a VAAM consisting of a pair of agonist and antagonist mechanisms. Changing the stiffness parameters (i.e., $K_{i}$) of the VAAMs enables AMOS (see Figure. 1 (c)) to achieve variable compliant leg motions, thereby leading to adaptive and energy efficient walking on six surfaces (see Figure. 1 (d)). The video clip of the advanced walking behavior can be seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odzf8iyt5y0 .",

        "text": "Sleep plays an active role in memory consolidation and especially slow wave sleep (SWS) seems to be important for the transfer of recently encoded memory representations into long-term stores.\n\nConsolidation of declarative memory relies on a dialog between neocortex and hippocampus, where cortical slow oscillations, thalamic spindles and hippocampal sharp wave ripples are thought to be key players. However, their individual contribution is not fully resolved.\n\nRecently, auditory closed-loop stimulation of slow oscillations has been shown to effectively enhance memory.\n\nIn this study we investigated the effect of phase-independent acoustic stimulation on declarative memory consolidation. Subjects were continuously presented groups of three click sounds (pink  noise of 50ms duration each) during slow wave sleep throughout the first half of the night. The first stimulus within a group served as a reset by triggering an individual slow oscillation event (K-complex).  The second and third stimuli were delivered such that they concurred in time with the predicted up states of the induced slow oscillations (P900 components). Between stimulus groups there was a pause of 5-9s.\n\nAlthough the induced oscillations are comparable to the phase-dependent version reported by Ngo et al. (2013) stimulation was not effective in changing the performance of human subjects in a paired associate learning (PAL) task (p=0.11, N=15).\n\nSpindle power was significantly enhanced in response to the first click (p<0.001, N=15), but it was decreased across the entire stimulation period (p<0.001, N=15). The latter was most pronounced in the 5-9s interval between tones. Contrary to spindle activity, power in the SO band (0.5-1.1Hz) increased during the stimulation period (p<0.05, N=15).\n\nOur results indicate that auditory stimulation applied independent of the endogenous slow oscillation phase is not sufficient to enhance memory consolidation.\n",

        "text": "Snake-like robots conventionally use undulation movements for locomotion [1], [2]. In contrast, a nonstandard snake-like robot having four screw-drive units which are connected serially by three active joints [3] uses propulsion by rotating its screw-drive units to move. Employing this screw-drive mechanism, undulation is not required for its locomotion. This helps it to move in narrow spaces. However, generating its goal-directed locomotion is a challenging control problem. In this work, we tackle the problem by using a reinforcement learning approach, called Policy Improvement using Path Integrals (PI$^2$) [4]. PI$^2$ is numerically simple and has an ability to deal with high dimensional systems. Here, it is used as a model-free learning mechanism to find a proper combination of seven locomotion control parameters (three yaw joint angles and four screw unit angular velocities) of the robot for moving towards a given goal. The learning process is achieved using simulation and the learned parameters are successfully transferred to the real robot.\nExperiments show that the robot with different body configurations (like, straight-line, zigzag, arc, etc.) can effectively move toward any given goal (see supplementary video at http://www.manoonpong.com/BCCN$2014$/SnakeRobot.wmv). In this way, a large repertoire of robot behaviors are obtained and used as motor primitives for generating other new behaviors online. By selecting different primitives and properly chaining them along with parameter interpolation and/or sensory feedback techniques, the robot can successfully handle complex tasks like, reaching a single goal or multiple goals while avoiding obstacles and compensating to a change of its body shape. \nTaken together this study suggests how the PI$^2$ reinforcement learning approach can be used to solve coordination problem of many degrees-of-freedom systems, like the nonstandard snake-like robot, and to generate goal-directed locomotion in a complex environment.",

        "text": "Correlations in neural activity can severely impair the processing of information in neural networks. In finite-size networks, correlations are inevitable due to common presynaptic sources. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these shared-input correlations. For networks of spiking neurons, the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback has so far been demonstrated explicitly only for homogeneous networks of neurons with linear subthreshold dynamics. The underlying theory, however, suggests that the effect is a general phenomenon which should occur in any recurrent system with inhibitory feedback, irrespective of the details of the network structure and the neuron properties. In this study, we investigate the effect of network heterogeneity on correlations in inhibitory networks with conductance-based synapses, implemented in analog neuromorphic hardware (Spikey) [3]. The configurability and precision of the hardware substrate allows us to modulate the extent of network heterogeneity in a systematic manner, and to selectively study the effects of shared-input and recurrent connections on correlations in synaptic inputs and spike trains. We confirm that shared-input correlations are actively suppressed by inhibitory feedback also in highly heterogeneous networks with broad firing-rate distributions. This decorrelation becomes, however, less efficient with increasing heterogeneity. While cell and synapse heterogeneity leads to a decrease in shared-input correlations, active decorrelation is impaired as a consequence of a diminished effective feedback. Overall, with intact feedback, we observe increasing correlations with increasing heterogeneity. Finally, this study demonstrates that the configurability, speed and user-friendliness of the Spikey neuromorphic system qualifies this analog hardware substrate as a powerful research tool to address neuroscientific questions.",

        "text": "In this work we experiment with velocity and direction predictions from visual information (\"visual odometry\") as a test­bed application for relational features, with potential applicability in automotive and robotics tasks.  \n\nA simple approach to learning motion representations by relating frames in a video is presented in [1]. The approach is based on detecting \"spatio-temporal synchrony\" between learned features and the observed frames across time. The model resembles “complex cell” like units, also known as motion energy models, which encode correlations between pixels across image pairs. In contrast to the classic motion energy model, the synchroy-based approach is a single-layer module that allows for local, Hebbian-type learning to extract features from video data. An extension to learning depth and motion information at the same time using multi-camera video data was subsequently presented in [2]. \n\nHere we incorporate the synchrony-based depth-motion modules into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn local representation for motion and depth from higher resolution stereo sequences. We then learn to relate the extracted representations to local changes in velocity and direction, thus we train the model to perform \"visual odometry\" from the data. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on the odometry dataset from the KITTI Vision benchmark [3], consisting of gray scale stereo sequences and real world pose information, collected from a driving vehicle. We train our model on local 3-D stereo patch pairs to predict local change in velocity and local change in direction. Preliminary results show that the architecture is capable of learning resulting mapping from video to ego­motion. Our work is a step towards a fully learning-based architecture, based on a single computational module and learning rule, to learn to extract motion, depth, and odometry information from raw data. Future work will focus on increasing the accuracy of the predictions.",

        "text": "There have been several contributions on human motion detection and action recognition over the past two decades. However detection of abnormal and suspicious behaviors in video surveillance is currently one of the most interesting studies for many research groups in computer vision and artificial intelligence. There are two well-known models to detect suspicious behaviors; misuse detection model and anomaly detection model. Misuse detection model is related to definition of suspicious behavior while anomaly detection model measures the difference between the defined normal behaviors and the current behavior. \nWe employed the first model to classify human behaviors into normal, abnormal and suspicious types according to trajectory and spatio-temporal domains. In the former we define some abnormal trajectories, like crinkle or loitering trajectories and then compare patterns of input trajectories for each person with the predefined abnormal trajectory. In the second domain some special regions on a scene which are not usual for walking are predefined. If a person stays there more than a threshold time, his behavior will be assumed as an abnormal one. Under some conditions abnormal type will be interpreted as a suspicious type. This is done by introducing a \"normality level\" which determines the commonality level of each behavior. If a behavior has a high \"normality level\" value, it is normal and lower values show abnormal and suspicious types of behavior. Employing both domains simultaneously provides high degree of accuracy in the proposed approach. In addition, introducing several level of abnormality according to the \"normality level\" parameter and having fuzzy approach led to differentiate between warning and alarm states. The above points plus on-line working of the system opposite of the complexity of its algorithms are positive points of our work. Our method detects abnormal and suspicious behaviors in the CAVIAR data set with an accuracy of 90% in real time.\n",

        "text": "The dynamics of highly parallel spike recordings can be characterized in terms of neural avalanches. The avalanche distributions reflect the correlations in activity across neurons, and across time. In vitro, avalanche size distributions $f(s)$ were found to approximate power laws [1]: $f(s) \\sim s^{-\\tau}.$ This indicates diverging correlation lengths, and is characteristic for self-organized criticality (SOC) [2], prompting the hypothesis that neural population dynamics may be  SOC. Moreover, SOC may provide a basis for optimal information processing [3]. However, evidence for the SOC hypothesis has been obtained only for coarse measures of neural activity (LFP, EEG, BOLD), but surprisingly not for spiking activity in vivo.\nTherefore we analyzed highly parallel spike recordings from rats (hippocampus), cats (visual cortex) and monkeys (prefrontal cortex). Across all species, the avalanche size distributions $f(s)$ were similar (Fig. 1A-C), but differed fundamentally from $f(s)$ in critical spiking models (Fig. 1D), even when accounting for subsampling (Fig. 1E) (see [4–6]). The differences between in vivo $f(s)$ and model $f(s)$ could be overcome by decreasing the model’s excitatory synaptic strength, while increasing its external input (drive) concomitantly (Fig. 1F). Thereby the model became sub-critical and lost its separation of time scales (STS), which is fundamental to SOC. These results also held for intracranial depth recordings in humans.\nOur findings indicate that the mammalian brain self-organizes to a slightly subcritical regime without STS. In this regime, avalanches are not temporally separated bursts as for SOC, but form a mélange. This regime may strike a balance between optimal information processing, which has been linked to SOC [3], and the need to avoid the supercritical regime, which has been linked to epilepsy.",

        "text": "Introduction\nHahne et al. (2012) [1] have shown that optimized spatial filters can significantly improve the performance and robustness of myoelectric control that is based on classification. Here we demonstrate that spatial filters obtained by the recently introduced source power correlation (SPoC) analysis can similarly boost performance in paradigms that allow for continous and proportional myoelectric control by means of regression.\n\nMethods\nSPoC is to optimizes spatial filters such that the power of the filter outputs maximally co-modulates with a continuous target variable [2]. This simplifies the task for the regressor and can therefore increase the estimation accuracy.\n\nExperimental paradigm:\nEMG signals were recorded from the forearms of 10 able-bodied subjects using a 192 channel electrode grid, while wrist angles were acquired for two degrees of freedom by a motion tracking system.\n\nData analysis:\nAs a baseline for comparison we use linear regression on log-var features extracted from non-overlapping 200ms blocks of the EMG channels to predict wrist angles, as was shown in [3]. In our proposed approach, log-var features are extracted from the outputs of spatial filters (optimized using SPoC) and subsequently used as input for linear regression. \nBoth approaches are evaluated using the $r^2$ value between the predicted and the actual wrist angles. Training and testing are done using 5-fold crossvalidation and $r^2$ values are averaged over the test folds of all subjects. \n\nResults\nThe performance is shown for different uniformly distributed channel sub-sets. As expected the r² generally increases with increasing channel sets. Increasing the number of SPoC components leads to a higher performance. Importantly however, a small number of SPoC components suffices for our proposed method to outperform the baseline approach for all channel sets. \n\nConclusion\nOur results show the effectiveness spatial filters for simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control.",

        "text": "Introduction:\nSubjects with upper limb deficiency have often difficulties to generate combined movements for training of regression-based myoelectric control systems. In this work we investigate the generalization abilities of linear regression (LR) to combined movements that are not included in the training-set.\n\nExperimental paradigm:\nEMG signals were recorded from the forearms of able-bodied subjects using a 192 channel electrode grid. The subjects performed a large diversity of combined wrist motions for the two degrees of freedom (DoF) flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation. Wrist angles were acquired by a motion tracking system. [1]\n\nData analysis:\nVariance, RMS, and log-var features were extracted from 200-ms intervals of the EMG to predict wrist angles with LR. The diversity of training movements was successively reduced from a dense coverage of combined motions to single DoF activations, while keeping the absolute amount of training data constant by increasing the number of repetitions. The performance was evaluated on independent test-data with the full motions-set in a 5-fold cross-validation and presented specifically for the entire range of motion.\n\nResults:\nFor Variance- and RMS features the estimation error increases in the outer regions. With log-var features the wrist angels were estimated well in all regions. The diversity of the training data had almost no influence on the distribution of the error which was approximately uniform. Even if only single DoFs were used for training, the estimation error was low for combined movements as well.\n\nConclusion:\nThe results show that log-var features are not only linear with respect to the investigated wrist inclinations, but also that the DoFs are separable, i.e. the individual movements superimpose linearly to combined motions in the muscle space.\n",

        "text": "How an ensemble of neurons wires together to form a functional unit is a fundamental problem in Neuroscience. The architecture of neuronal wiring, in fact, determines how neurons communicate and may be important for information processing performed by neuronal networks. However current knowledge is mainly limited to networks consisting of a small number of neurons, while the topological structure of biological networks remains still unknown. Primary neuronal cultures represent an ideal preparation to investigate the basic principles of network dynamics.  At the mature stage, they display network-wide synchronous bursting events (SBEs) . Interestingly, high-density MEA recordings have shown that SBEs actually correspond to propagating activities through the network. Typically, the simulated SBEs originated from a few and specific sites as in [1], but the nature and the role of such events is still under debate. In order to investigate the determinants of such dynamics, we developed a computational model that mimics the main features of the recordings obtained by a high density multi-electrode-array device (4096 electrodes inter spaced by 20um, [2]). With only a few topological constraints the model expressed realistic SBEs  along time and could be well clustered in only few groups that differed for the ignition sites and propagation directions (see Figure 1). \nInterestingly, cellular heterogeneity also showed to contribute to the ignition of these  propagations.   \n\nIn the end, our neural network model replicates most of the salient firing properties observed in experimental investigations, it clarified the underlying mechanisms that determined the neural propagations  and serves now as a ground true for the analysis and predictions of new experiments.\n",

        "text": "A multiscale physical model of Shaker-type K$_{\\mathrm{V}}$ channels is used to span from atomic-scale interactions to macroscopic experimental measures such as charge/voltage (QV) and conductance/voltage (GV) relations. The model comprises the experimentally well-characterized voltage sensor (VS) domains described by four replications of an independent continuum electrostatic model under voltage clamp conditions$^1$$^{,2}$ and a hydrophobic gate controlling the flow of ions by a vapor lock mechanism$^3$, connected by a simple coupling principle derived from known experimental results and trial-and-error. The total Hamiltonian of the system is calculated from the computed configurational energy for each components as a function of applied voltage, VS positions and gate radius, allowing us to produce statistical-mechanical expectation values for macroscopic laboratory observables over the full range of physiological membrane potentials ($|V| \\le 100$~mV, in $1$~mV steps).\n\nThe Shaker QV and GV relations seen in Seoh et al (1996) and the effects of pore mutations seen in Yifrach and MacKinnon (2002) are predicted by this model. With this approach, functional energetic relations can be decomposed in terms of physical components, and thus the effects of modifications in those elements can be quantified. We find that the total work required to operate the gate is an order of magnitude larger than the work available to the VS, and that the the experimentally observed bistable gating is due to the VS slide-and-interlock behavior.\n\nThe same model is systematically applied to VS charge mutants (Seoh et al, 1996). The QV and GV relations can be qualitatively predicted and the associated effects on functional domains determined. Additional features such as surface charges become significant for the pathological cases. Our engineering approach clearly elucidates that both normal function and mutant changes are electrostatic in nature.",

        "text": "A major challenge in computational neuroscience is to achieve high performance for real-time simulations of full size brain networks. Recent advances in GPU technology provide massively parallel, low-cost and efficient hardware that is widely available on the computer market. However, the comparatively low-level programming that is necessary to create an efficient GPU-compatible implementation of neuronal network simulations can be challenging, even for otherwise experienced programmers. To resolve this problem a number of tools for simulating spiking neural networks (SNN) on GPUs have been developed [1,2], but using a particular simulator usually comes with restrictions to particular supported neuron models, synapse models or connectivity schemes. Besides being inconvenient, this can unduly influence the path of scientific enquiry.\n\nHere we present GeNN (GPU enhanced neuronal networks), which builds on NVIDIA's CUDA architecture to enable a more flexible framework. GeNN is based on the idea that much of this optimization can be cast into heuristics that allow the GeNN meta-compiler to generate optimized GPU code from a basic description of the neuronal network model in a minimal domain specific language of C function calls, which may also be obtained by translating variables, dynamical equations and parameters from an external simulator such as Brian 2 [3] and SpineCreator/SpineML [4]. The first release version of GeNN is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/genn.\n\nWe have executed performance and scalability tests on an NVIDIA Tesla C2070 GPU with an Intel Xeon(R) E5-2609 CPU running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Our results show that as the network size increases, GPU simulations never fail to outperform CPU simulations. But we are also able to demonstrate the performance limits of using GPUs with GeNN under different network and simulation scenarios, confirming the that GPU acceleration can differ largely depending on the particular details of the model of interest.",

For in-vivo like fluctuating inputs spiking model neurons exhibit stochastic dynamics which can be effectively characterized using the Fokker-Planck equation (see, e.g., [2 - 5]). This approach leads to a model with an infinite-dimensional state space and non-standard boundary conditions, however, the spike rate dynamics can be approximated by a low-dimensional ordinary differential equation in different ways [4, 6, 7]. Although these approximation techniques are interrelated it is not clear which reduced model best reproduces the spike rate of the original spiking model neurons, depending on the statistics of the input. In this study we first extend each of these reduction methods to account for neuronal adaptation and then evaluate the reduced models in terms of reproduction accuracy for a range of biologically plausible input statistics, computational demand and implementation complexity.",

It is, however, presently not well understood how switching between these network states occurs. One switching mechanism might involve slowly decaying potassium currents (so-called adaptation currents) because they strongly affect neuronal spiking dynamics [2, 3] and are directly controlled by (top-down) neuromodulatory systems [4]. \nHere we consider networks of adaptive spiking model neurons [5] receiving in-vivo like fluctuating inputs and characterize the role of neuronal adaptation in (de)stabilizing network states. From this network model we derive a low-dimensional description for the population-averaged instantaneous spike rates, thereby retaining a direct link between network activity and neuron biophysics. Additionally, this approach allows for the application of powerful methods to analyze the stability of network states, where, for example, stability bounds can be calculated for general coupling topologies [6, 7].\nUsing this framework we demonstrate how changes in neuronal adaptation lead to the (de)stabilization of asynchronous states, fast oscillatory activity originating from recurrent excitation-inhibition loops and slow oscillations for sufficiently strong recurrent synaptic excitation. We therefore identify network regimes where switching between different dynamical states can be mediated by brain intrinsic neuromodulatory signals that target adaptation currents.",

        "text": "How neural circuits integrate sensory information to produce appropriate actions is a fundamental question in neuroscience. We aim to address this question using the optokinetic behavior (OKR), a response consisting of reflexive eye movements elicited by rotational whole-field motion1,2. Even such a simple response involves coordinated activity in hundreds of neurons distributed in areas throughout the brain, so mapping the underlying neural dynamics requires an unbiased approach to systematically sampling the responses of many neurons. Using two-photon imaging we recorded activity, with single-cell resolution, throughout the whole brain of zebrafish expressing GCaMP5G in most of its neurons, while the fish performed optokinetic eye movements. Here we present whole-brain maps of the average activity dynamics during these slow sinusoidal tracking movements. The network is sparse, broadly distributed and highly symmetric, with areas on opposite sides of the brain active at opposite stimulus phases. By aligning each imaged brain to an anatomical reference, we compared the spatiotemporal structure of activity during OKR across individuals, and found that, throughout a large portion of the network, it is highly stereotyped, down to the scale of single neurons. Using stimuli designed to dissociate sensory and motor aspects of the behavior, we systematically map which signals are represented in different brain areas, identifying areas that represent different aspects of the stimulus or motor variables such as eye position and swimming behavior3. These whole-brain functional maps provide a comprehensive view of brain dynamics during sensorimotor integration and are an important step towards the characterization of complete vertebrate neural circuits controlling behavior. Importantly, by identifying the areas related to particular aspects of the behavior, they allow us to single out small groups of neurons with specialized function and target them for more detailed analysis.",

        "text": "Survival requires an organism to behave such that its vital sensory variables remain within healthy limits, a principle we refer to as Sensory Homeostasis (SH). The suggestion that SH is a driving force behind adaptive behavior can be traced back to the early days of cybernetics [1], and similar mechanisms have augmented evolutionary robotics for dealing with sensory perturbations [2,3]. However, unlike the well-established theory of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [4], no framework exists that formulates SH as a target for learning a goal-directed behavior. Here, we introduce such a framework, and the family of learning mechanisms resulting from it, which do not depend on finding the policy that maximizes future reward. Instead, target probability distributions of the vital sensory variables are defined such that they reflect the goal-directed demands of the agent, i.e., they are sharply centered around their healthy limits. The fact that goals are represented by target distributions, and not by a single scalar reward, makes the method applicable to the concurrent learning of multiple behaviors. The method is model-based, and necessary distributions, such as those of sensors and the internal world model are sampled and updated during learning [5]. Learning of an optimal policy is then achieved by minimizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the target distributions and the actual distributions of the agent's sensory signals, observed during behavior. The Jensen-Shannon divergence eliminates the asymmetry and non-smoothness the Kullback-Leibler divergence suffers from. Learning is sped up by updating the policy using the natural gradient [6] of the divergence. We demonstrate the viability of learning through SH on a simple discrete-variables two-choice operant conditioning task. We also discuss the potential of extending the method to continuous variables, and its implementation as a synaptic plasticity mechanism between sensory and motor neurons.",

        "text": "Precise spatio-temporal activity patterns are relevant for information processing in the brain. One example is the salamander retina where the relative spike times in different neurons carry more information about the stimulus than the latency of single neurons relative to stimulus onset [1]. Also, rats can be trained to differentiate between simultaneous and time-ordered electrical stimulation in two seperate locations in the brain, even when the difference in stimulus onsets is as low as one millisecond in time-ordered condition [2]. These findings raise the question which synaptic plasticity mechanism in the brain might establish precise spike associations. Curiously, the canonical Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity is not suited for this task. Here, we propose a simple Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity rule (MPDP), which is based on experimental reports [3, 4]. Due to the stereotypical dynamics of the membrane potential, MPDP is also sensitive for spike times. Since the membrane potential is a non-local signal available at the synapse, it conveys information about the progress of learning. This allows MPDP to terminate synaptic plasticity as soon as the desired association is achieved, which is required for high capacity. We demonstrate the performance of MPDP in two paradigmatic neuronal networks, the perceptron and the chronotron. We show that MPDP can be mapped to the Perceptron Learning Rule and thereby inherits its highly desirable properties. For the Chronotron, we find that it achieves very high capacity, while also providing robustness against noise. We conclude that MPDP is a powerful plasticity principle that can be tested experimentally.",

        "text": "Song birds learn to imitate tutor songs from sensory memories, which implies a precise sequence of motor activations to reproduce a specific sensory experience. It has been proposed that this is realized by inverse models that map desired sensory representations onto motor activations to produce the respective motor gestures [1].\n\nThe biological mechanisms that form inverses of non-linear forward mappings of spatio-temporal activity patterns in closed loop situations containing substantial delays are unclear. We propose a conceptually simple, functionally complete, and biologically plausible approach to learning such inverse models in networks of spiking neurons.\nIt exploits the interaction between a membrane potential dependent learning rule that keeps the membrane potential bounded and the afterhyperpolarisation of the neuronal membrane potential after each spike. The afterhyperpolarisation of motor neurons serves as a biological trace of earlier activations, which implies that it will take more input to drive the neuron above threshold than at resting state. We show that with these assumptions random motor explorations robustly lead to causal inverse models from sensory to motor representations which provides a plausible explanation for the remarkable imitation skills in song birds, as well as for experimentally observed mirror neurons.\n\nHowever, for song learning, not only an inverse model is needed, but also a way to store the memory of the tutor song. Such a memory template consists of a specific temporal pattern of activity in the brain that can be learned and recalled. How neuronal networks can learn to store such temporally precise patterns is not known. We suggest that a variant of the learning paradigm used for generating the inverse model can also serve to store activity patterns of this type. Thus, we propose a fully functional model of the song bird that self-organizes with a single plasticity mechanism.",

We view several apparently-strange neurological phenomena in the light of the working hypothesis that the brain hovers near the brink of criticality; that it devotes considerable resources to maintaining this; and that failures in which parts of the brain enter an undesired super-critical regime are not uncommon.  This basic idea seems to cast light on a variety of phenomena.  In essence, we posit that some pathological conditions are the result of inappropriate super-critical dynamics.  This naturally explains certain puzzling observations in a variety of apparently unrelated conditions.  In particular, we consider: (a) the closely related phenomena of sleep and epilepsy [7,8]; (b) tremor and deep brain stimulation [9]; and (c) non-psychotic hallucinations that follow from diminished sensory input such as Charles Bonnet syndrome, phantom limb, and tinnitus [10].",

        "text": "Many computational properties of cortical networks can be faithfully reproduced by Winner-Take-All (WTA) networks (Douglas & Martin, 2007). Such networks, typically comprising ensembles of recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, can implement a variety of non-linear operations including signal restoration, amplification, max-like winner selection, i.e. decision making, or filtering. However, in order to implement such operations the network connections need to be fine-tuned to satisfy certain constraints imposed by theoretical stability conditions (Rutishauser et al., 2011). It has been an open question whether and how WTA circuits can achieve this fine-tuning through biologically plausible synaptic plasticity mechanisms.\nWe show how the desired circuit motif can emerge autonomously through an interplay of plasticity mechanisms that operate simultaneously on all excitatory and inhibitory synapses of an initially random network. We analyze the stabilization properties of the proposed mechanism in a mean field model using contraction theory, and find constraints for the model parameters that ensure self-calibration of the network. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through computer simulations.\nOur main result provides simple constraints on the plasticity rule parameters, rather than on the weights themselves, which guarantee stable WTA behavior. This work sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of both local functional circuits and larger assemblies of interconnected WTA networks.",

        "text": "Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are state-of-the-art algorithms that can extract hierarchies of spatial features from input data. Although they are loosely inspired by cortical processing hierarchies, and can be trained as generative models for static data, they cannot capture the temporal characteristics of real-world inputs. Previous models have combined DBNs into spatio-temporal architectures by conditioning current visible variables on previous ones [1] or by using recurrent connections between hidden variables [2]. Here we present a novel architecture for a brain-inspired dynamic generative model for spatio-temporal input sequences, which combines the spatial processing hierarchy of a DBN with a short term memory in the form of a reservoir computing architecture.\nWe propose a new computational framework called Deep Temporal Networks (DTNs), which consists of a Self-Organized Recurrent Neural Network (SORN) [3] that processes high-level spatial input features coming from the output of the highest layers of a DBN. The reservoir of the SORN architecture adapts its inner weights using local plasticity rules such as STDP to learn temporal dynamics of different sequential inputs. Additionally, synaptic normalization and intrinsic plasticity are applied to maintain stable dynamics inside the reservoir. The combination of SORN and DBN creates a powerful computing architecture, which can not only classify temporal sequences, but via feedback from the SORN into the DBN also generate new sequences, e.g. complete a spatio-temporal pattern after seeing only part of a sequence. We validated the performance of this architecture for completing temporal sequences using noisy artificial data and gestures recorded with a DVS128 neuromorphic vision sensor [4].\n",

        "text": "Different tasks in neural systems seem to be solved by similar anatomical motifs. This observation spawned interest in common principles of information processing implemented in such motifs. These common principles by definition cannot be cast in processing-task specific language. Thus, to formulate an information processing principle without recurring to task-specific semantics, we have to use a task-independent framework, such as information theory. Information theory has been used to formulate unifying neural information processing principles, such as the goal function of the Coherent Infomax Principle (CIP)[Kay&Phillips]. The CIP goal function prescribes that a neural processor fed by driving bottom up inputs and modulatory contextual inputs should pass on both, information that is shared by driving input and context and information that is only in the input, but block information only available in the context. \nHowever, classical information theory used in CIP does not cleanly separate these goals. A separation only becomes possible when using the recently introduced framework of partial information decomposition (PID)[Williams&Beer]. PID allows to decompose the mutual information between inputs and outputs of the neural processor into unique contributions from driving and modulatory inputs, as well as the information they share about the output (redundancy) and the mutual information they only  jointly have about the output (synergy).\nUsing PID, we show that the CIP goal function indeed implements the desired principles of information processing, but lacks the ability to use the context as a key in decoding inputs. Moreover, the CIP's focus on redundancy conflicts with the principles of hierachical predictive coding. In sum, CIP is ideally suited for information processing within a level in a hierachy. For processing between levels we suggest a goal function that reflects predictive coding ideas and provides decoding capabilities via synergistic information.",

        "text": "Highly parallel recordings can reveal avalanches of neural activity. In vitro, the sizes $s$ of these avalanches follow a power-law distribution $f(s) \\sim s^{-\\tau}$ [1]. Power-law distributions are a hallmark feature of a critical state, which has been linked to optimal information processing [2]. Therefore, it was suggested that criticality governs neural activity [1,3].\nThe comparison between neural population dynamics and critical models is hampered in two ways: First, it was up to now impossible to achieve a “truly critical” state in models due to finite size effects.  Second, in the experiments at most a few hundred neurons can be recorded in parallel. This unavoidable subsampling can distort the observed dynamics, and hampers inferences about the dynamics of the full model [4–6]. \n$f(s)$ of a classical stochastic branching model [7,8] shows a cutoff at around N=100, the number of model neurons, due to finite size effects (Fig. 1A, blue). To overcome the finite size effects, we added a rapid, activity dependent adaptation of the synaptic strength. The adaptation mechanism diminished the finite size effects, and allowed $f(s)$ to extend over more orders of magnitude, i.e. the model was much closer to critical (Fig 1A, red). When subsampling this novel model (sampling n=10 out of N=100 neurons) $f(s)$ hardly changed, while subsampling in the classical model lead to a strong deviations from power law (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, $f(s)$ in both models could be inferred from the subsampled activity using a rescaling approach.  In addition, under subsampling the topology of the full network is reflected in $f(s)$, and hence inferences about the “connectome” can be drawn.",

        "text": "The thalamus provides prominent input to the neocortex in sensory and motor systems. This input activates inhibitory local interneurons more intensely than excitatory neurons, providing a powerful feedforward inhibition (FFI) [1]. We studied the functional implication of the FFI on the dynamics of the balanced cortical network. We show the FFI plays a key role on levelling the co-variability in the recurrent network dynamics.  Our result suggests the FFI recruits inhibition to form the basis of strong correlations among local inhibitory neurons, while suppressing the noise correlations between pairs of excitatory cells. This founding explains how output activity of cortical circuits substantially uncorrelated and detrimental correlations due to input are eliminated.",

        "text": "The synaptic cleft is an EC domain that is capable of relaying a presynaptically received electrical signal by diffusive NTs to the postsynaptic membrane. The cleft is trans-synaptically bridged by ring-like clusters of pre-/postsynaptically localized calcium-dependent adhesion proteins of the N-Cadherin type and is possibly the smallest intercircuit in nervous systems [1]. The strength of association between the pre- and postsynaptic membranes can account for synaptic plasticity such as LTP [2]. By neuronal activity the intra- and extracellular calcium levels are modulated through calcium exchangers embedded in the pre- and postsynaptic membrane. Variations of the concentration of cleft calcium induces changes in the N-Cadherin-zipper, that in synaptic resting states is rigid and tightly connects the pre- and postsynaptic domain. By synaptic activity calcium concentrations are hypothesized to drop below critical thresholds which leads to loosening of the N-Cad connections and subsequently \"unzips\" the Cadherin-mediated connection. These processes may result in changes in synaptic strength [2]. To investigate the calcium-mediated N-Cad dynamics at the synaptic cleft, we developed a three-dimensional multi-scale model including cleft morphology and all prominent Ca-Exchangers and corresponding density distributions and molecular dynamics of the Ca-dependent N-Cads [3-6]. The necessity for fully three-dimensional multi-scale model becomes apparent, when investigating effects of e. g. spatial architecture of a synapse [7-8] or dynamics and effects of the conformational changes of the N-Cads. We see the localization of Ca-Channels w.r.t. the N-Cad ring has substantial effects on the time-scales on which the N-Cad-zipper switches between states, ranging from seconds to minutes. This will have significant effects on synaptic signaling. We see high-frequency AP firing can only  be relayed to the Calcium/N-Cad system at a synapse by precise spatial synaptic reorganization.",

        "text": "Investigation of cellular and network dynamics in the brain by means of modeling and simulation has evolved into a highly interdisciplinary field, that uses sophisticated modeling and simulation approaches to understand distinct areas of brain function. Depending on the underlying complexity, these models vary in their level of detail, in order to cope with the attached computational cost. Hence for large network simulations, single neurons are typically reduced to time-dependent signal processors, dismissing the spatial aspect of each cell. For single cell or networks with relatively small numbers of neurons, general purpose simulators allow for space and time-dependent simulations of electrical signal processing, based on the cable equation theory. An emerging field in Computational Neuroscience encompasses a new level of detail by incorporating the full three-dimensional morphology of cells and organelles into three-dimensional, space and time-dependent, simulations. While every approach has its advantages and limitations, such as computational cost, integrated and methods-spanning simulation approaches, depending on the network size could establish new ways to investigate the brain.  In this poster we present a hybrid simulation approach, that makes use of reduced 1D-models -- using e. g. the NEURON simulator -- which couples to fully resolved models for simulating cellular and sub-cellular dynamics, including the detailed three-dimensional morphology of neurons and organelles. In order to couple 1D- and 3D-simulations, we present a geometry-, membrane potential- and intracellular concentration mapping framework, with which graph-based morphologies, e. g. in the swc- or hoc-format, are mapped to full surface and volume representations of the neuron and computational data from 1D-simulations can be used as boundary conditions for full 3D simulations and vice versa. Thus, established models and data, based on general purpose 1D-simulators, can be directly coupled",

        "text": "Dendritic spines as well as the dendrites they emerge from are filled with structure like actin filaments which, like the plasma membrane, carry static charges on their surfaces and will therefore have an effect on the local potential. It remains unclear, however, how strong this effect is and if it can influence the postsynaptic signal processing of incoming action potentials.\nIn order to investigate any possible effect, we have developed a numerical model applying the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation for electro-diffusion to the context of neuronal ion dynamics, thus introducing a full-dimensional description of these dynamics that captures the local relationship between potential and charge carriers more physically accurately than a simple one-dimensional cable equation. The governing equations are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot\\left( D_i\\nabla c_i + D_i\\frac{z_iF}{RT}c_i\\nabla \\Phi\\right)$$\n$$-\\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r\\nabla\\Phi\\right)=F\\sum_iz_ic_i,$$\nwhere $c_i$ are the ion species and $\\Phi$ the potential.\nBoundary conditions for the full-dimensional problem modeling the local dynamics of a spine and a small part of the surrounding dendrite are given by a 1D model reduction for the rest of the cell assuming a cylindrical dendrite with varying radius.\nSimulations have so far only been carried out for the 2D case and turn out to be numerically difficult making further research on the treatment of the 3D case necessary.",

        "text": "An important challenge in neuroscience is to understand how networks of neurons are processing information. Chemical synapses are key players in this context as they define the interfaces that transmit signals between neurons and other cells. However, a quantitative assessment of the underlying processes is often hindered by the complexity of the experimental system and the physiological interrelationships at synapses. In this project we attempt to overcome these experimental limitations by an interdisciplinary approach that aims at mathematically reconstituting critical parameters of a well accessible and simple synaptic system, the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (DNMJ).\n\nTowards this end we have developed a detailed 3d mathematical model of presynaptic processes based on realistic morphological and physiological data from DNMJs that includes the spatio-temporal vesicle cycle within presynaptic boutons as well as the detailed calcium dynamics at active zones that couples neuronal activity patterns with the properties of vesicle release machineries. The model comprises the description of 3d reaction-diffusion processes with non-linear (inner) boundary conditions. The resulting system of coupled partial differential equations is discretized in space and time and numerically solved with the help of multigrid techniques.\n\nBased on this model and its verification by experimental data (see accompanying poster Leung et al.) we found that the two glutamatergic bouton classes of larval NMJs, type 1s and type 1b boutons, show distinct overall presynaptic calcium dynamics that correlate with the size of the bouton and the number of harbored active zones. The kinetics of the overall calcium buffering in both bouton types predicts that 1s and 1b boutons can only accommodate specific maximal stimulation frequencies without interferences. These estimates correlate well with experimentally observed natural firing patterns of both neurons.",

        "text": "The Frankfurt vision initiative fuses insights from systems engineering and brain sciences to develop a platform for cognitive vision. In past work we have described our systems engineering perspective for visual cognition wherein the cognitive vision system configuration and parameters are viewed as a mapping from the cross-product space of “application domain contexts, sensor modality types and configurations, tasks, and performance requirements” to “dynamic system design configurations and parameters” [1, 2]. These dynamic system configurations mimic dual-system cognitive architectures that perform massively parallel hypotheses generation followed by deliberation/reasoning and optimization [3]. \nIn order to do this systematic exploration of tradeoffs in visual cognition system design, we exploit a graphics simulation platform that allows rich scripting of application contexts and generation of large amounts of video sequences along with pixel level and meta-data ground-truth. Our simulation platform is built on top of graphics tools for domain specific scene creation and rendering. Key features of the module include, flexible scene graph to create domain-specific scenes, rendering the data with multiple annotations (include semantics, bounding boxes, tracks, scene flow, surface normal, edges, reflections, texture, Illumination, diffuse and specular componants, geometry of scene, camera and lighting etc.) for performance analysis and optimization, and flexible storage of data and distributions. The platform consists of (i) virtual reality tool, Vizard [5] to create scenes, (ii) GLSL [6] to annotate image data by GPU shaders, and (iii) HDF5 [7] to store the data and annotations. Concrete applications in video surveillance and driver assistance for automotive domains are currently being used as case studies for our platform. The work flow of the simulation process and sample frames generated by the proposed module, are shown in the Figure.",

        "text": "In a large variety of situations one would like to have an expressive and accurate model of animal or human behavior. While general purpose mathematical models may capture successfully properties of observed behavior, it is desirable to develop computational models that answer the question why behavior was carried out and  to root models in biological facts at the implementational level. Because of ample empirical evidence for reward-based learning in visuomotor tasks we use a computational model based on the assumption that the observed agent is balancing the costs and benefits of its behavior to meet its goals. This leads to using the framework of Reinforcement Learning, which additionally provides well-established algorithms for learning of visuomotor tasks. To quantify the agent’s goals as rewards implicit in the observed behavior we propose to use inverse reinforcement learning, which quantifies the agent’s goals as rewards implicit in the observed behavior. Based on the assumption of a modular cognitive architecture, we introduce a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that estimates the relative reward contributions of the component tasks in navigation, consisting of following a path while avoiding obstacles and approaching targets. It is shown how to recover the component reward weights for individual tasks and that variability in observed trajectories can be explained succinctly through behavioral goals. It is demonstrated through simulations that good estimates can be obtained already with modest amounts of observation data, which in turn allows the prediction of behavior in novel configurations. We infer implicit costs and benefits from measured navigation behavior from human subjects in a variety of tasks and show that subjects never fully followed the given tasks instructions but instead were also driven by additional intrinsic costs. Finally we show, that human eye movements during navigation are tightly linked to the inferred rewards.",

        "text": "Heterogeneity is an intrinsic feature of complex biological systems. As it demonstrably affects robustness and reliability of network responses it should have great functional relevance [7, 8].  We have only recently begun, however, to study the phenomenology of heterogeneity, and the neuronal mechanisms underlying it [4, 5].  Of particular interest is the dynamic interplay between asymmetric spike train correlations and spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity ( $\\textit{STDP}$ ) [6].\n\nPreviously, correlation in the responses of spiking neurons with shared input were studied for weak correlations only [1].  In the strongly correlated regime, only limited theory is available [2, 3]. This regime was mainly studied numerically [4].  Here we have a semi-analytical look into the mechanisms of correlation asymmetry in different regimes.  We were able to identify two mechanisms that contribute to correlation asymmetry: $\\textit{desynchronization}$ and $\\textit{relative stretch}$. In the strongly correlated regime, inputs private to each neuron, as well as intrinsic heterogeneity, strongly influence the degree of $\\textit{desynchronization}$ in short time windows.  On the other hand, the contribution of $\\textit{relative stretch}$ to correlation asymmetry under similar conditions is more prominent in moderately and weakly correlated regimes. We study and compare roles of these two asymmetry mechanisms in heterogeneity of neuron interactions (EPSPs etc. ), as spike train correlations are integrated by a given $\\textit{STDP}$ rule.",

        "text": "The balanced state of recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons is characterized by fluctuations of population activity about an attractive fixed point. Numerical simulations show that these dynamics are essentially nonlinear, and that the intrinsic noise (self-generated fluctuations) in networks of finite size is state-dependent. Therefore, deterministic equations with additive stationary noise cannot provide an adequate description of the stochastic dynamics. Rather, the noise model should result from a self-consistent description of the network dynamics. Here, we consider a two-state Markovian neuron model, where spikes correspond to transitions from the active state to the refractory state. Excitatory and inhibitory input to this neuron affects the transition rates between the two states. The corresponding nonlinear dependencies can be identified directly from numerical simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, discretized at a time resolution in the sub-millisecond range. Deterministic mean-field equations, and a noise component that depends on the network size, are obtained from this model. The resulting stochastic model reflects the behavior observed in numerical simulations quite well. In particular, a strong temporal correlation between the two populations, a hallmark of the balanced state in random recurrent networks, are well represented by the model. Numerical simulations of such networks show that a heavy-tail distribution of excitatory and inhibitory short-term spike counts is another property of such networks with fixed in-degree, and our model shares this statistical property. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the mean flow from simulated time series suggest that the mean-field dynamics of finite-size networks are essentially nonlinear. We expect that this novel nonlinear stochastic model of interaction between neuronal populations opens new doors to analyze the dynamics of multiple interacting networks.",

Although the underlying anatomical structure provides constraints, it is not sufficient to determine the dynamics. Additionally, it is easier to evaluate activity than to access the structure directly.\nWith techniques like calcium imaging or functional magnetic resonance imaging, a large number of constituents can be observed, but it is still difficult to resolve dynamical processes both temporally and spatially. We present results on the extension and application of a recently proposed method which infers effective connections from a covariance matrix acquired from measured activity. An initially undirected estimate is converted to a directed network, by exploiting information from indirect connections under the assumption that the underlying network is relatively sparse. This can be done for covariance functions in the frequency domain, but also for zero-lag covariances caused by processes that are faster than the experimental time resolution. \nWe apply the method to datasets which were acquired using the MR-encephalography technique, which measures full brain BOLD signals with a higher temporal resolution than conventional fMRI (frame rate 5 Hz). We compare information from different frequency bands in the datasets and discuss problems arising from high noise levels as well as shared input, for example from respiratory effects.",

        "text": "In our research we investigate the role of haptic feedback for grasping and manipulating objects in a closed sensorimotor loop. In order to learn and improve manipulation behaviors, predicting tactile stimuli from efferent motor signals is a major step. For tactile predictions, a model of the object shape needs to be built and simultaneously an estimate of its location maintained, while manipulating the object. This requires to continuously match perceived tactile stimuli with the current object representation and to decide, whether the object representation or the estimated object location need to be adapted according to the input.\n\nInspired by findings of the neural processing in haptic and visual pathways, features such as position, surface orientation and surface curvature are computed from tactile contacts [1]. These serve as inputs to a neural-dynamic model, using dynamic neural fields (DNF) [2] for implementing this matching process. The object shape representation is learned within memory traces of these DNFs [3], capturing shape relevant aspects such as the position and orientation of detected surfaces and edges.\n\nThe model is evaluated in robot experiments, where two fingers of a Shunk Dexerous Hand 2 rotate cylindrical n-gon objects. Using the object representation, the model is able to compensate for errors and drifts in the estimated rotation of the object and its one-dimensional position. It is shown, that the model is able to lead to self-consistent object shape representations, within four full rotations of the object.\n\nFuture research will focus on the prediction of tactile stimuli from the learned object shape representation.",

        "text": "Plasticity of ion channel distribution at the neuronal membrane is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in neural functioning. Groups of ion channels can be regulated on short time scales by the activation of membrane receptors for neuromodulators (NM). Each NM receptor can influence ion channels (including AMPA, NMDA and GABA-A channels) directly by local interaction in protein complexes, or by signalling into the cytoplasm and influencing ion channel activity and expression distally. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is sufficient to anchor G-protein coupled receptors (NM receptors) in specific places during recycling processes (deactivation, endocytosis, degradation), and therefore localize them permanently (1,2). Regulation by NM receptors may be part of long-term memory (3).  We suggest that NM receptors code for executable subroutines expressed by the membrane ion channel composition. We present a simulation model where the coding properties of a collection of neurons are changed simultaneously through the activation of one or more dominant NM receptors, leading to a different set of dendritic branches and synapses being active. For instance, Gi$\\beta \\gamma$ activated GIRK channels at spines introduce slow IPSCs (4) and voltage-gated potassium channels influence dendritic branch transmission (5), (Fig.1).This results in a regulation of the flow of information through the network by NMs, corresponding to state-dependent memorization and activation of memory content. Since NM receptors can be optically manipulated at the single cell level (5), simulation models may be developed together with direct experimental evidence.",

        "text": "Hand grasping requires the transformation of visual object information into corresponding hand actions. In the primate brain these processes are linked to area AIP (anterior intraparietal cortex), F5 (ventral premotor cortex) and M1 (primary motor cortex). Although these areas demonstrate selective responses when hand movements are planned or executed, it is up to now unclear how visual and motor information is encoded on the neuronal population level.\nTo address this question, we trained two macaques to grasp up to 50 different objects in a delayed reach-to-hold task. In this, we measured the kinematics of hand and arm together with spiking activity recorded from up to 300 single- and multi-units using microelectrode arrays. The high variation of visual stimuli and motor responses in this task allowed us separating visual attributes of objects from motor features of the hand. Canonical variant and hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated a dominant visual role of AIP during both the planning and execution epoch. The neural population separated the objects primarily based on their shape and secondarily on their size. Furthermore, we found indicators for the processing of object affordances relevant for grasping. In contrast to AIP, we could identify in F5 a distinct motor representation that encoded the objects in motor terms. However, the highest correspondence to the recorded hand kinematics was observed in the M1 population activity that closely matched the multi-joint space of the hand and arm. \nTogether our results demonstrate distinct roles of AIP, F5, and M1 at the population level that are highly relevant for understanding how visumotor transformations are processed in the brain.",

        "text": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that contaminates frequently cereal grain and cereal-based food and feed worldwide and is thus becoming a serious health risk to humans. It is assumed that DON alters the neurochemistry of the brain, specifically the levels of biogenic monoamines in the central nervous system, causing feed refusal, emesis and anorexia. The FAO issued guidelines and regulatory limits for DON in cereals and food products. To keep the compliance with regulations, tools for fast and accurate DON estimation have to be developed. Aptamers for ligand binding are already known and are suitable as potential recognition elements for biosensors. Here, we describe the selection of DNA aptamers reacting on DON with different affinities. The selection is based on the formation of aptamer bacons upon DON binding. A single-stranded, random DNA library comprising 6.6 x $10^{14}$ different molecules was reversible bound to an affinity column. Sequences which underwent a conformational change consequently to the addition of DON were collected and amplified. After 12 rounds of selection, the enriched pool was analyzed on the included sequences. Out of 76 sequences, 39 were chosen for a detailed binding analysis, among which, 14 reacted to the application of DON.",

        "text": "Two neuronal morphologies, distinguished by the position of the soma, have developed in the animal kingdom. In vertebrates, the soma is typically located in a central position between axon and dendrites. In higher invertebrates, the soma is externalized at the end of a so-called stem neurite, which connects the soma to axon and dendrites. We hypothesize that the position of the soma – central or externalized – fulfills a functional role. Commonly, the externalization of the soma in higher invertebrates is explained by spatial constraints. We suggest that, as an additional benefit, the soma position is optimized to enhance the energy efficiency of neuronal signaling.\n\nBased on multi-compartmental models, we compare the signaling costs for both morphologies. The lower the passive attenuation of a dendritic signal along its way to the spike initiation site, the lower the amount of metabolic energy that needs to be invested in its propagation. We show that in this context, the energetically most favorable soma position depends on the relative diameters of the soma and the processes protruding from it (i.e. dendrite and stem neurite). Intuitively, a large central soma provides a current sink, while an externalized soma is partly “shielded” by the stem neurite. We predict that externalized somata are larger than central somata, when compared to the diameter of their processes. Indeed, an analysis of previously published morphological data from various cell types confirms a correlation between soma position and relative soma size. We hypothesize that for vertebrates, a central soma position serves as a central switching point for the control of neuronal output. In this case, small somata help to constrain the energetic costs. Accordingly, originally somatic organelles may have been shifted into proximal dendrites (such as the endoplasmatic reticulum) as a result of an evolutionary optimization process to decrease the relative soma size.",

        "text": "Pyramidal cell dendrites are endowed with active ionic conductances, which do not only foster dendritic signal propagation [1], but also play a role for synaptic plasticity. In order for Hebbian forms of plasticity to occur, synapses in the dendrites have to be informed about spikes elicited in the axon hillock. While backpropagating action potentials provide this information to synapses at medium distances from the soma, including those on apical oblique and basal dendrites [2,3], calcium spikes induce plasticity in the more distant apical tuft synapses [4]. Interestingly, these two dendritic regions  are also targeted by different interneuron populations. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons typically synapse onto the proximal dendritic and somatic parts of the neuron, while somatostatin-positive interneurons provide input to the apical dendrite. The matching compartmentalization in terms of the type of dendritic spikes and inhibitory control suggests that inhibition could differentially regulate dendritic spikes and hence introduce a compartment-specific modulation of synaptic plasticity.\n\nWe evaluated this hypothesis in a biophysical multi-compartment model of a pyramidal neuron, receiving shunting inhibition at different locations on the dendrite. Our analysis shows that inhibition could gate dendritic spikes in an all-or-none manner. Moreover, spatially selective inhibition could individually suppress backpropagating action potentials and calcium spikes, allowing for a compartment-specific, binary control of backpropagating dendritic signals, with compartment-specific consequences for synaptic plasticity. Finally, we suggest that disinhibition of calcium spikes can account for a change in a neuron's firing mode, which has recently been observed when silencing presynaptic inhibitory interneurons [5]. \nThe proposed mechanism could implement a pathway-specific switch of cellular computation, a potentially useful feature for learning and the formation of memories.",

        "text": "Chemical synapse defines the interface that transmit signals between neurons and their recipient cells, the ability to transmit signals in a dynamic and use-dependent manner make it an important player in the information processing of a neuronal network. Since calcium is the key regulator of neurotransmitter release, it is not surprising to learn that the dynamics of calcium in the presynaptic processes are spatio-temporally optimized to best serve their function. In this project, mathematical and experimental approaches are combined to quantitatively access presynaptic calcium dynamics in high precision. At Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a three-dimensional mathematical model of presynaptic bouton is reconstituted (see accompanying poster Stepniewski et al.,) and then experimentally validated on critical parameters. Simulated results of the net calcium influx to the entire presynaptic bouton are first validated by data from the calcium imaging experiments using genetic calcium sensors, GCaMP3 and GCaMP6, of different sensitivity. The net calcium influx and its kinetics are then compared between two bouton type, 1s(small) and 1b(big), which are specialized in transmitting nervous stimulations at different frequencies. Furthermore, the kinetics of calcium efflux between the two bouton types were compared from electrophysiologically measured paired pulse ratio, which is an indirect indication base on the increased release probability results from presynaptic calcium build-up during temporally closely paired stimulation. Our combined results demonstrate that the architecture of the type 1s and 1b boutons, essentially the bouton size and number of active zones, are optimized to facilitate different calcium dynamics, which serves faithful transmission at lower and higher frequencies respectively.\n",

        "text": "One of the most typical properties of natural human movements is that one movement is not independent but involved in a sequence of other movements. A movement segment can affect its successor (carry-over coarticulation) or its predecessor (anticipatory coarticulation). In redundant motor systems coarticulation can be found in end-effector trajectories and in joint angles. As both kinds of coarticulation influence movements at different points in time, a comparison between them can help us to understand the generation of movement better.\nTo examine coarticulation in human arm movements, a cylindrical object was moved from a starting position to a position at the center and from there to a final position. To analyze carry-over coarticulation, six starting points and three final targets were arranged around the central target. To examine anticipatory coarticulation, one starting position and four final positions were used. To ensure complete attention to the task, the targets were given by visual cues that had to be memorized and were removed before each trial.\nTo uncover coarticulation in joint angle configurations, we applied an analysis of motor equivalence based on the concept of the uncontrolled manifold. We decomposed the difference between joint configurations in different conditions into components that leave the position of the transported object invariant (UCM) and those that affect the position of the object (ORT). Motor equivalence is observed when this difference lies more in the UCM than in the ORT (same spatial trajectory, but moving through different joint configurations).\nDirection-dependent coarticulation was visible in the end-effector and in joint angles. However the preparation of a movement seems to be distinctly different from its post-processing. While carry-over coarticulation was mainly visible in the joint angles, it was different for anticipatory coarticulation. Here the influence on end-effector was more distinct.",

        "text": "In everyday listening situations, reverberation due to sound reflections in the environment is very common. However, in most cases the auditory system is able to adapt to the reflections and we are unaware of them. This is also expressed by an increase of the echo threshold, i.e. the minimum delay to hear a reflection as an echo becomes longer after hearing the echo repeatedly, which is not only the case for single echoes, but also for echoes that are part of a complex room impulse response. Changes in the directional pattern of sound reflections disturb the adaptation process and for a short period of time after the change, the reflections become audible. While many studies exist for single reflections or simple patterns, only few results have been produced for realistic reverberant environments. The present study addresses the question how changes in the reflection pattern of a reverberant environment are perceived. Realistic simulations of reverberation in different rooms are created using a high order image source model. By altering parameters of individual image sources, such as their direction, unrealistic reflection patterns are created which nevertheless maintain key  properties of the room such as the direct-to- reverberant ratio and the reverberation time. This study tests the hypothesis that, compared to realistic reverberation patterns, differences can be observed in the release from adaptation for unrealistic reverberation patterns.",

        "text": "While neuroscience is one of the most dynamic branches of science it still has a lot of unsolved problems in the field of information processing principles. To solve these problems a great variety of computational neuroscience methods are applied. To reproduce the principles of brain dynamics in brain-inspired information processing devices, neuroprosthetics hardware or “silicon” neurons and neural networks are used.[1–3].\nWe investigated the dynamics of phase-locked loop with a specific bandpass second-order filter in the control loop. Phase-locked loops (PLL) are devices commonly used in radio technologies, telecommunication systems, electronic circuits, etc. to synchronize and stabilize controlled generator in accordance to the reference one [4,5]. The main working regime of PLL is synchronization between controlled generator and the reference signal. In this case, a constant signal exists in the control loop. When the loop is not able to compensate the differences between two signals it produces the oscillations whose complexity depends on the type of filter in PLL. PLL order is one greater than the order of the filter. It means that in the case of second-order bandpass filter PLL dynamics is described by the third-order ODE. Third order dynamical systems could demonstrate a complex behavior including the chaotic one. In our model regular nearly harmonic, regular and chaotic bursting oscillations have been found. The results of numerical simulations and analysis was presented in the paper [6]. The observed oscillations were qualitatively similar to some dynamic modes of the neuron membrane potential.\nDue to the high prevalence of PLL, the technology of its creation is well established and suggesting the possibility to produce the designed PLL microcircuits. We have developed a prototype of the PLL with bandpass filter and have found the same modes as in the numerical simulation. The oscillogram of the chaotic bursting mode of the prototype is shown on figure 1.",

        "text": "As emerging technology reveals new data on neural connectivity, there is an explosion of interest in understanding the underlying network. Connectivity appears complex and departures from being purely random. One way of characterizing this is via connectivity motifs [1,2] (Fig. (c)). \n\nWe give the first theory of how the statistics of such connectivity motifs can give rise to a basic network function. We consider a signal input to a recurrent network, and an output defined as a sum over the activity in all of its elements (Fig. (a)). We assume that the elements are identical, and that each is modeled by a linear input-output transfer function of its own. We then use tools from control theory to describe the network-wide transfer function, which characterizes input-output behavior of the network as a whole.\n\nWe find that the network-wide transfer function is determined by the statistical prevalence of chain motifs (Fig. (c)) along with the single-unit transfer function. We show this by developing a series expression of the transfer function that shows contributions of each motif in order. The prevalence of a motif is quantified by a graphical quantity we call the motif cumulant; importantly, in practical examples they fall off quickly with size of the motif [3,4]. The consequence is that measurements of prevalence of motifs involving only a few cells, when assembled through our expression, are often enough to predict the behavior of a network as a whole.\n\nThe way that motifs combine to determine the network-wide transfer function has an intriguing structure (Fig. (b)). This reveals how networks structure shapes the network transfer function to produce varied spectral and temporal features (Fig. (d)). We also provide examples where these features may be employed to sustain functions such as signal de-noising and extending the time constant with which signals reverberate in a network. Our theory is readily generalized to cases such as random input and output weights.",

        "text": "How variable and noisy is the neural code arising from the joint activity of recurrently connected cells? Isolated neurons are known to respond to fluctuating input currents with reliable spike patterns, but variability in stimulus-evoked spike trains is increasingly pronounced in deeper, more recurrently connected brain areas such as cortex. What are the network-level sources of this variability, and how they might constrain spiking features relevant for coding remains an open question.\nWe focus on spiking model networks with sparse, random connectivity and balanced excitation and inhibition that reproduce the irregular firing that typifies cortical activity. In such models, activity is known to be chaotic, with extremely strong sensitivity of spike outputs on tiny changes in a network’s initial conditions. Nevertheless, when subject to temporally fluctuating driving inputs, networks can have chaotic attractors of limited dimension and geometric properties leading to reduced spiking variability at the single-cell level. As recent studies suggest that the impact of noise on network coding cannot be understood by single cell properties alone, we study mechanisms underlying the joint activity of entire networks.\nWe derive a bound for the entropy of joint spike pattern distributions in large spiking model networks in response to a fluctuating temporal signal. The analysis is based on results from random dynamical systems theory and complimented by detailed numerical simulations. We find that despite very weak conditional correlations between neurons, the resulting joint variability of network responses is surprisingly lower than what would be expected by considering only limited statistical neural interactions. Moreover, joint spiking variability is strongly constrained by the level of temporal features of input stimuli.\n",

        "text": "Among the plethora of spatial and temporal activity patterns population bursting is observed in brain neuronal networks under various experimental conditions [1-2]. Being intensively investigated experimentally this phenomenon has found to be an essential feature for dissociated cultures of neuronal networks. However, dynamical mechanisms of population bursting still remain poorly understood. Computational modeling provides a comprehensive insight to the network level mechanisms of generating and propagating spiking activity[3-4]. Here we present a computational model of neuronal network composed of Izhikevich neurons interconnected with Tsodyks-Uziel-Markram synapses [5-6].\nThe network consisted from several neuronal populations reproducing the ratio between fractions of different neuronal types presented in the experiments with cultures. The model was implemented using CUDA technology, providing significant accelerations of the simulations.\n\nUsing computational modeling key characteristics of population bursts (i.e. period, duration) werere measured depending on various network parameters. Epileptiform seizure-like activity in the form of superburst discharges was observed in the model under certain values of the model parameters. The critical role of different parameters in generating superburst activity was investigated and the parameter ranges and conditions crucial for the presence of different types of superbursts were revealed.\nWe found that variation of single synaptic parameters didn't significantly change bursting period. Also altering most of the parameters slightly affected the bursts duration. The only parameter corresponding to decaying time of excitatory postsynaptic currents significantly influenced the burst duration. Increasing this parameter also led to superbursts appearing. Our results indicate that the superbursts emerges when the balance between inhibition and excitation shifts toward the higher excitability.",

        "text": "Rats gather information about their environments with a numerous behavioral strategies and sensory sampling patterns. Traditionally, place-cell firing fields are derived from locomotive epochs, without differentiation of the diverse sensory sampling patterns (i.e. sniffing, whisking and head turns). Early studies of hippocampal place coding attributed variability of spatial tuning to either internal neural processes or behaviour-reward structure of the task (c.f. Fenton et al 2010). At the same time contribution of overt behavioral variables to spatial representation is poorly understood. Here we posited to demonstrate that much of observed variability of place-cell tuning stem from an incomplete behavioral characterization. \n\nWe captured the complexity of exploratory behavior of a rat by means of marker-based 3D tracking of biological motion. With this technique we achieved high spatial (~100um) and temporal (~8 msec) resolution, which allowed accurate behavioral state segmentation. \n\nFirst, we used both empirically-derived and discriminant analysis based (QDA, trained on expert labeling) classification features to automatically segment and classify across sessions and animal such behavioral states as walking, rearing, head turning, head-bobbing and autonomic behavior.\n\nSecond, refined analysis of kinematic features of the rat’s head and body motion (height and pitch) allowed us differentiating two modes of so-far assumed homogeneous walking state, which we speculate correspond to random foraging and vision-based navigation. \n\nThird, we investigated spatial and temporal aspects of hippocampal place cell firing during different walking states. We found that majority of place cells exhibited complete change of spatial tuning properties between walking states, ranging from rate to place remapping. \n\nWe argue that changes of spatial representation across newly discovered two patterns of walking are associated and result from distinct sensory sampling modes.",

        "text": "Information coding in the brain has been associated with precise timing of neuronal spike firing and internal oscillatory dynamics. This timing strongly depends on the presence of fast membrane potential fluctuations, which mostly rises from endogenous high frequency oscillations in the gamma range (30-150 Hz). Previous studies have shown that activation of local cortical networks is associated with the transient emergence of local gamma oscillations (Sirota et al 2008). To extend this work to all cortical layers we used multiple silicon probes to record extracellular field potentials and multiple single unit activity across all cortical layers in somatosensory cortex of rats during awake and sleep. Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts, independently detected in time, frequency and space, revealed the existence of multiple putative gamma oscillators. These gamma bursts were spatially confined to superficial and deep layers, exhibiting distinct ranges of oscillation frequency and synchronized with local ensembles of neurons, suggesting the existence of several distinct circuits that generate these oscillations. In order to explore the mechanistic role of gamma oscillations across sleep and awake states, as well as the mechanisms responsible for the slow time scale dynamics of gamma oscillations, we characterized the modulating effect of cortical slow oscillations, hippocampal theta rhythm and optogenetic subthreshold AC modulation on gamma oscillatory dynamics. All identified neocortical gamma oscillators were temporally coordinated by the slow rhythms, but with notable difference depending on the laminar and frequency localization of the oscillator. We hypothesize that analysis of circuit-specific neocortical dynamics with respect to hippocampal theta and slow oscillations is instrumental for understanding the mechanisms of information flow via these circuits during learning and memory consolidation.",

        "text": "Acetylcholine (ACh) modulates neuronal responses, leading to functional effects at the network level, including cortical desyncronisation and modulation of theta oscillations in the hippocampus. The complexity of ACh actions suggesting spatially heterogeneous dynamics demands for sensitive measurements in multiple brain regions with high spatio-temporal resolution.\nIn this work, we developed enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors to assess cholinergic activity with high spatio-temporal resolution and sensitivity. The approach was based on the amperometric measurement of H2O2 generated by choline oxidase (ChOx) in the presence of Choline (Ch) and O2. \nThe electrodes consisted in two side-by-side disk shaped 50 µm diameter Pt/Ir wires. This design is inexpensive, scalable, provides high spatial resolution for hippocampal measurements and optimizes rejection of noise and interferents in vivo by sentinel channel subtraction. The Ch measuring site was coated with ChOx and chitosan cross-linked with benzoquinone. For the sentinel, ChOx was replaced by BSA.\nElectrochemical measurements were done using a multichannel miniature head-stage (NPI). The biosensors had a detection limit of 10 nM Ch and a response time of ~2 s.\nIn anesthetized rats, local field potential features were extracted from the recording together with Ch dynamics. Sustained Ch increases during theta periods reached amplitudes up to 5 µM in cortex and 1 µM in hippocampus CA1. Brief theta/desynchronization were accompanied by Ch changes involving decreases followed by slower increases. Control experiments indicated that Ch responses were independent of physiological O2 changes, in agreement with the KmO2 of 2 µM determined in vitro.\nThe data supports the reliability of the biosensors to measure cholinergic activity in the brain. Spontaneous Ch changes suggest bidirectional modulation of cholinergic tone. We are currently combining these sensors with multichannel electrophysiology in freely moving rodents.",

        "text": "Although the importance of synaptic plasticity has long been recognized, the plasticity of the various forms of cortical inhibition has recently started to attract increasing experimental and theoretical attention [1,2]. Amongst its possible manifestations, it was suggested that plasticity operating directly on inhibitory synapses could establish both firing rate homeostasis and a state of balanced excitation and inhibition [3]. In recurrent networks, feedback inhibition is provided through a multi-synaptic loop, suggesting that excitatory firing rates might also be controllable via modification of synapses elsewhere in this loop. Among those, the excitatory synapses onto inhibitory cells have access to the excitatory firing rate as a presynaptic signal and are thus promising candidates to be homeostatic regulators thereof. Here we test this hypothesis in a variety of simple networks. When an homogeneous excitatory population provides the sole input to an inhibitory population, a rate homeostasis can indeed be obtained (Fig 1A). However, even small heterogeneities within the excitatory population cause neurons with high activity to take control of the inhibitory neurons, resulting in an over-inhibition of less active neurons (Fig 1B). Such competition arises because plasticity-induced changes in inhibitory firing, intended to control a particular excitatory cell, will ‘spill over’ to other excitatory cells due to the fanout of inhibitory feedback connections. Rate homeostasis of any excitatory neuron in the circuit would thus require a coordinated change in all excitatory-to-inhibitory synapses, indicating that such an “indirect” homeostatic plasticity rule must be nonlocal. Consequently, indirect inhibitory plasticity is unlikely to be sufficient for homeostatic rate control.",

Such systems are described by a stochastic reaction diffusion equation with additive noise coupled to a control variable with multiplicative noise but no diffusion. It has been recently observed in the mathematical literature that noise in interplay with possibly super-linearly growing nonlinearities may result in numerical artifacts or even divergence of the numerical schemes.\n\nWe have shown in a couple of articles, [SaSt1, SaSt2] that the widely used finite difference approximations are consistent for any neuronal model with locally Lipschitz continuous and quasi-monotone coefficients, a natural assumption in the biophysical context. We also derive explicit error estimates for the approximate solution that are consistent with the best rates known in the literature.\n\nAs applications, we present the Hodgkin-Huxley and FitzHugh-Nagumo systems with noise, in particular the construction of explicit confidence intervals for statistical estimators of the underlying dynamics useful in the calibration of models to given data.\n",

Particular emphasize is put on pulse solutions  modelling the action potential travelling along the nerve axon. Within the theory, stochastic diffferential equations describing the wave speed of the action potential under the impact of noise, can be derived and further analyzed to quantify the statistics of time jitter, but also propagation failure and further secondary effects like backpropagation and annihilation of action potentials. \n\nOur analysis is based on a new mathematical approach to the stability properties of travelling pulse solutions of stochastic nerve axon equations, first introduced in the paper [1] for 1D-Nagumo equations, and subsequently in paper [2] for general stochastic bistable reaction-diffusion equations. \n\nThe stability properties of travelling waves are intrinsically characterized in terms of the reaction potential without requiring further explicit knowledge on the specific shape of the wave profile nor its a priori unknown velocity. \n\nOur methods can be carried over also to wave fronts in stochastic neural field equations. The corresponding results concerning a mathematical rigorous multiscale analysis for stochastic neural field equations are containded in the paper [3]. \n",

        "text": "The dynamics of networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory activities have originally been examined in phenomenological models with fixed weights [1,2]. Those early studies have proposed that such a balance in large scale networks results in irregular firing of the neurons which enables the network to switch rapidly between different states. \nStimulus preference and memory storage are thought to be encoded in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths. The majority of more recent network models have focused on examining the role of excitatory plasticity rules [3,4], although some studies have also considered the potential impact of various inhibitory STDP rules [5,6]. \nThe focus of the present work is on assessing the robustness of balanced activity in feedforward and sparsely connected recurrent networks with plastic excitatory and inhibitory connections. In our investigation, we find that the parameter space in which the overall activity neither disappears nor explodes is rather limited, and that the biologically plausible parameter space is limited further still. To resolve this problem, we introduce short-term facilitation and depression factors for disynaptic and monosynaptic connections respectively that account for the short-term EPSP and IPSP amplitude dependence on presynaptic frequency (implied by electrophysiological studies, monosynaptic [7] and disynaptic [7,8]). The goal of this modification is achieving individual neuron and whole population behaviour that is characterized by a stable limit cycle and results in a balanced network activity for a much wider range of biologically plausible parameter values. \nAs an expression of this changed population behaviour, we measure the duration over which stimulus preference in feedforward and memory storage in recurrent networks are maintained.",

        "text": "Recent studies demonstrated that spontaneous brain activity can form clusters in space and time – neuronal avalanches – the statistics of which have been shown to follow a power law. This phenomenon has been observed in tissue cultures, acute slices, and anesthetized as well as awake animals (Beggs & Plenz, 2003; Petermann et al., 2009). Power law relationships may indicate a phase transition, therefore suggesting that some biological neural networks might be operating at a critical regime between order and chaos.\nSeveral functional benefits of criticality in neural networks have been pointed out, such as maximum dynamic range of sensory input, optimized information transmission and larger information capacity (Shew & Plenz, 2012). However, it is not clear if such networks will be optimal in performing learning tasks. An attribute of the critical state is that the response to an input can be an avalanche of events of any possible size – implying that there is no characteristic emergent response. In the context of reservoir computing that we will consider, it seems rather unlikely for this property to be helpful in learning. Moreover, maintaining the network in a critical state may require particular fine-tuning of the parameters. The inputs into the reservoir might disrupt the balance that is at the heart of the critical state and thus the network could turn uncritical (Rajan et al., 2010).\nBy combining reservoir computing (Jaeger & Haas, 2004; Maass et al. 2002) with simple limiter control (Corron, 2000; Stoop & Wagner, 2003) we control the state of a spiking recurrent network which performs pattern recognition task, in stable, critical and chaotic regimes (depending on implemented parameters). We argue that for an optimal performance it is required to back away from the critical point to a more stable state. Additionally, the properties of the nonautonomous combined input/reservoir dynamical system and the influence of input on the network’s state is analyzed.",

        "text": "The connectivity between neurons - i.e., the number of synapses and their synaptic weights - determines information processing and storage in neural networks. Thus, to understand the functionality of neural networks, we have to understand how they generate their connectivity. Along this line, there are two major mechanisms to modify connectivity: First, synaptic plasticity adapts the synaptic weights of existing synapses. Second, structural plasticity creates and removes synapses. Hereby, the main influence is the volume of the dendritic spine [1] hosting the synapse. This volume is, in turn, linked to the synaptic weight [2]. Both mechanisms are also  influenced by the activity pattern of the network. Thus, to understand how the connectivity in adult neural networks is generated, it is important to understand the interaction of neural activity and the different plasticity mechanisms. \nHere, we focus on a property of cortical connectivity: the characteristic, bimodal distributions of the number of synapses connecting two neurons [3-6]. To investigate how these distributions can emerge from the interaction between synaptic and structural plasticity, we use a probabilistic model, which captures the process of structural plasticity by abstracting it with weight-dependent probability functions. This allows us to analytically calculate the distribution of the number of synapses between two neurons. We then show that the bimodal synapse distributions from cortex will arise when using synaptic plasticity rules with synaptic weights growing with the postsynaptic activity. Given such a synaptic plasticity rule, the different biologically observed distributions for different cortical layers can be explained at corresponding activities with a single set of parameters. \nSurprisingly, albeit using a probabilistic model, the multi-synaptic connections are stable against overly fast activity changes due to a hysteresis, which also indicates a capability of information storage.",

        "text": "Synaptic plasticity (Long-term potentiation LTP and long-term depression LTD) acts on different time scales [1,2]. The short-term plasticity (STP) lasts 20-30 minutes, while  early-LTP (E-LTP) lasts approximately 1-3 hours, and  late-LTP (L-LTP) lasts for more than 10 hours to days. Biological evidences show that late-LTP involves protein synthesis, while early-LTP and short-term plasticity do not. Importantly, the requirement of synthesis of cellular protein is not sufficient to induce synaptic late-LTP. A synaptic tag must also be marked during early-LTP [5]. According to this observation, a model on consolidation of synaptic plasticity[4] was proposed. \nOn the other hand, for the short-time scales, postsynaptic calcium entry mediated by NMDARs and voltage-dependent calcium channels has been shown to be a necessary and sufficient signal to induce synaptic plasticity. A model was proposed in which the occurrence of synaptic potentiation or depression depends on the postsynaptic calcium concentration [3]. This model captures and reproduces many protocol patterns  experimentally observed in hippocampus and neocortex.\nWe combine the synaptic tagging model [4] with calcium-based synaptic plasticity [3] by linking the short-time scale synaptic plasticity to long-time scales.  With this combined model, amongst others, we analyze how early-LTP/LTD protocols as spike-timings induce late-LTP/LTD. Further, we are able to show effects of the tag-induced cross-talk between several pre-synaptic inputs dependent on input rate, correlation, etc.\nIn summary, our combined model is the first plasticity model capturing the synaptic dynamics from milliseconds to hours or rather days.\n\n",

        "text": "Coexisting attractor states in neural networks provide a possible mechanism for memory and classification [1,2]. It has previously been shown that firing-rate bistability in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can arise from the interplay between the firing rate and the mean and/or the variance of the synaptic input [3,4]. In the variance-driven form of attractor dynamics the excitatory and inhibitory inputs on average cancel and the firing is generated by fluctuations in the input currents. This balanced form of attractor state potentially explains the highly irregular firing typically seen in experimentally recorded spike trains [5].\n\nHere, we investigate the role of inhibition and synaptic timescales in variance-driven attractor states. Using a mean-field model, we study the minimal connection strength required for bistability and its dependence on synaptic and network parameters. We find that the variance-driven attractor is promoted by few but strong inhibitory synapses, thereby providing an additional rationale for the distributions of excitatory and inhibitory weights found experimentally [6]. In a cortical network where excitatory synapses outnumber the inhibitory synapses, the persistence of variance-driven attractor states is hardly affected by the time constant of excitatory synapses (in contrast to mean-driven attractor states [7]).\n",

        "text": "Cell assemblies (i.e. goups of highly interconnected neurons) emerge due to correlated neuronal activity, for instance induced by external inputs. Thus, they represent features of the external inputs and are likely to play an important role in the formation of associative memory in the neocortex (Lansner 2009). Various models have been published demonstrating different ways of formation and functional usage of cell assemblies (Buzsáki 2010). However, in most of these models the subset of neurons forming a cell assembly is chosen purely randomly or artificially predefined. Here, we combine the principles of self-organizing maps (Kohonen 2013) as well as those of cell assembly formation to demonstrate the self-organized emergence of highly input specific assemblies. \n\nThe simulated network consists of an input layer that projects via plastic synapses to a plastic recurrent neural network. Each network neuron receives excitatory inputs from other network neurons within a given radius. Inhibition is introduced by a global inhibitory neuron mutually interconnected with all network neurons via non-plastic synapses. All neurons are modeled by rate-based leaky integrator units. Synaptic plasticity is modeled by a generic combination of Hebbian plasticity and synaptic scaling (Tetzlaff 2011). \n\nAlternately, different subsets of input neurons are activated. Comparable to self-organizing maps, clusters of neurons tuned to one of the input patterns emerge. For disjunct or only slightly overlapping and temporal sufficiently separated input sets, cell assemblies are learned fast and reliable. In case of high overlaps, we find that only after a certain number of pattern presentations the system is able to discriminate them. Similar dynamics are observed for  patterns that are presented immediately consecutive or even overlapping. In general, our observations indicate an interesting interplay between inputs and the self-organized formation of cell assemblies.",

        "text": "The ability to estimate time intervals in the range of seconds to minutes is critical to many of our cognitive abilities. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still not well understood. To tackle this problem, we propose implementing timing tasks in virtual reality (VR) as an extension of classical approaches. VR setups for rodents recently became popular, since with them advanced neurophysiological recording techniques can be used in the behaving animal.\nWe designed two different tasks, based on well known interval timing tasks, to probe time perception in rodents in VR. Our tasks require estimating temporal intervals while running along a virtual hallway. Using VR we can ensure that the animals indeed perform time estimation. In VR the test environment can be designed without prominent spatial cues thereby preventing alternative solution strategies. In addition, movement speed and optical flow can be de-correlated, such that the animals can not learn a mapping between stimulus duration and running distance. The first task is a modified ready-set-go task in which the animals estimate the duration of a visual stimulus and reproduce it by running. This behavioral readout allows for responses on a continuous scale. In addition, specific intervals do not need to be trained beforehand. The second task is a time bisection task. Here, the animals are asked to estimate the time they run down the hallway until the projection switches to a Y-shaped maze. They then need to choose either the left or the right arm of the Y-maze to report if the interval was perceived as long or short, compared to previously trained reference intervals. \nWe successfully used the above tasks in experiments with Mongolian gerbils and present data from experiments in which we tested timing of durations between 2 and 13 seconds. The results are consistent with reports from previous studies and hence demonstrate the applicability of our approach to probe interval timing in rodents.",

        "text": "A robust, yet curious phenomenon has almost single-handedly spawned modern-day cognitive neuroscience. If a cue is presented at a location, the efficacy of subsequent orienting towards that location is improved relative to other locations, but only immediately afterwards. A mere few hundred milliseconds later, orienting incurs large costs. These costs have been classically termed “inhibition of return” (IOR), alluding to voluntary, cognitive strategies avoiding perseverance at one location. However, despite this popular hypothesis, the origins of IOR remain elusive. Here we show that classic IOR can be fully accounted for by the simple fact that motor systems are intrinsically rhythmic. We developed and experimentally validated a model that only takes into account saccadic rhythmicity to fully replicate orienting dynamics, including early “attentional capture” and later IOR. In this model, based on one we recently published (Hafed & Ignashchenkova, 2013), cues reset the phase of ongoing saccadic rhythms through classic countermanding. Orienting efficacy towards subsequently presented targets simply depends on the phase of the saccadic rhythms at which these targets appear. Critically, the model only works if the entire gamut of saccadic activity, including tiny microsaccades, is taken into account, and only when known dynamic interactions in countermanding take place (Hafed & Ignashchenkova, 2013). The most striking property of the model is that it predicts that microsaccades can be extremely rare but still influence performance, consistent with our data. Thus, phase modulation of motor rhythmicity explains the facilitatory/inhibitory influences of cues independent of high-level cognitive strategies. More broadly, the strong explanatory power of simple resetting mechanisms in our model suggests that classic attentional modulations may be manifestations of existing oscillatory fluctuations in brain state – fluctuations that are merely uncovered when cues reset them.",

        "text": "The first processing circuit of olfaction (antennal lobe or olfactory bulb) exhibits a number of surprising nonlinear features, but how these emerge collectively remains an open challenge. We stress three open puzzles. First, the antennal lobe of insects is capable of separating sensory input representations from two different odor signals. At the same time, our recent experimental work [1] suggests that the same circuit may also join representations of other pairs of odors. Second, studies on olfactory bulb have shown that gradual mixtures of two odors generate representations among projection neuron activities that split a large set of mixing ratios into two or three discrete representational classes. Third, the same circuit can simultaneously be robust against smaller concentration fluctuations, exhibiting concentration invariance, yet sensitive to larger average concentration changes. Taken together, these studies suggest that the same circuit processes information in distinctly different, nonlinear ways that depend on the input only. How do these nonlinear processing modes collectively emerge in recurrent circuits?\n\nHere we propose [2] that first olfactory processing circuits actively use and combine the highly heterogeneous circuit connectivity [3] with the nonlinear local input-output responses. Ex-perimental evidence suggests that whereas some interneurons connect to only one or a few other glomeruli, others connect to many. We now show that heterogeneous connections of interneurons may selectively inhibit particular sets of sensory neurons, thereby translating a dense into a sparse coding scheme in a systematic way. As a consequence, specifically het-erogeneous inhibition may provide an integrating view on the debated role of interneurons by offering one simultaneous answer to (at least) all of the above three puzzling findings in sensory neuroscience.\n",

        "text": "Despite the fact that feature-based attentional modulation is commonly observed in primate extrastriate visual cortex, little is known about the the underlying modulatory circuit. Specifically, how feature-based modulation is distributed when multiple features are attended simultaneously is not well understood.\nWe trained a macaque in a complex match-to-sample paradigm, designed to direct attention to different features. A random dot pattern (RDP) instructed the monkey which out of three matching rules to apply. The movement of the RDP, its color, or both combined had to be compared to a subsequently shown test stimulus. We recorded responses of single units from motion-sensitive area MT for 16 different test stimuli which occurred as targets and non-targets during each session.\nWe found that the firing rate increased for preferred target stimuli relative to non-target stimuli. This was regardless of which feature was attended or which rule was applied. Specifically, neurons which were modulated by the presence of target directions also fired more strongly when the motion of the RDP was irrelevant, but a target color was presented. Most notably, in the case in which a conjunction of two target features had to be detected, MT single units were already fully modulated when just one of the two target features was present.\nAn analysis of the time-courses of feature-based modulation revealed that in motion selective area MT, feature-based attentional modulation to motion emerged almost ‘in step’ with stimulus evoked activity. Attention evoked by target colors emerged later during stimulus presentation. In cases in which both features were attended simultaneously, we observed a complex interaction between the two types of modulations.\nOur results are consistent with a theory of a unified, object-based attentional system, which is not selective enough to directly contribute to the behavioral choice of the monkey when a complex feature-matching rule has to be applied.",

        "text": "Grid cells are a key component of the spatial representation in high-end cortices in the brain. Located in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC), they merge information coming from the neocortex and establish a recurrent loop with the hippocampus, known to store spatial memories. During a critical developmental phase, grid cells gradually come to express a prototypical hexagonal pattern of activity as a neural correlate of the animal's position. These cells are thought to contribute to spatial cognition, to the formation of episodic memories and, ultimately, to have an important role in spatial navigation. However, which phenomena are responsible for this neural activity remains unknown and controversial. In a biologically plausible candidate model to explain the properties observed in grid cells, two factors control the self-organized development of grid-like activity: adaptation and associative learning. While adaptation determines the typical grid spacing, Hebbian learning strengthens the association between position and multi-peaked activity. In virtue of its dependence on exploration, this model predicts specific patterns in non-flat environments. In the special case of hyperbolic geometry of constant negative curvature, regular tessellations of space other than hexagonal ones are possible. In this work, we show that in a physical realization of this geometry, the so-called pseudosphere, grid activity derived from our model can be organized in a heptagonal array, for a specific range of the ratio between grid spacing and pseudosphere radius. Moreover, tessellations with larger coordination numbers or even more complex organizations can be obtained and characterized by controlling any of these two geometrical factors.",

        "text": "The neuroanatomical connectivity of cortical circuits has been shown to follow certain rules, the exact origins of which are still poorly understood. One such rule is that excitatory synaptic sizes (and, correspondingly, efficacies) follow a long-tailed, approximately lognormal distribution. A second such rule is the so-called common neighbor rule, which states that the connection probability between any two neurons increases with the number of shared neighbors. We show how both experimentally observed properties can arise as a consequence of the interaction of multiple plasticity mechanisms in a recurrent spiking network model. We additionally reproduce several experimentally observed elements of synaptic dynamics. Our model is a recurrent network of inhibitory and excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons embedded in a two-dimensional sheet. The network combines spike timing dependent plasticity with two homeostatic mechanisms (synaptic normalization and intrinsic plasticity) and a structural plasticity mechanism for the pruning and creation of synapses. We show that this establishes a long-tailed, approximately lognormal distribution of synaptic efficacies consistent with previous modeling results and experimental data on synaptic strengths and sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the distance-dependent formation of new synapses can account for the some aspects of the experimentally observed common neighbor rule. Our results demonstrate that fundamental neuroanatomical features of cortical wiring can arise as a consequence of the interaction of multiple plasticity mechanisms and physiological constraints.",

        "text": "Vision is an active process involving different kinds of eye movements. How are these movements controlled and what are the underlying neural signals? How is this control learned during development? Biomechanical simulations can help us to better understand the underlying problems of visual perception and motor control. Here we introduce OpenEyeSim, a detailed three-dimensional biomechanical model of the human extra-ocular eye muscles (Figure 1) including a visualization of a virtual environment. The main purpose of OpenEyeSim is to serve as a platform for developing models of the joint learning of visual representations and neural control of eye muscles in the perception-action loop. The architecture and parameters of OpenEyeSim are based on measurements of the human eye [1,2] and it allows to simulate realistic types of eye movements. For our simulations we use the biomechanical simulator Opensim [3], an open source software that already implements a variety of muscle models and includes many musculoskeletal models. In order to allow modeling closed-loop interaction with the visual environment, we have extended OpenSim such that we can place virtual cameras into the rotating eyeballs and simulate visual processing. For the sake of simplicity, muscles are represented as solid objects and pulleys are fixed (passive pulleys). An interesting direction for future research will be modeling layered muscles that have orbital and global layers, as well as implementing the active pulley model presented by Miller [4]. Even without such extensions, however, the model is already suitable for studying the development of visuomotor control. For instance, current work is exploiting OpenEyeSim to develop a model for the joint development of disparity tuning and vergence control during infancy. We suggest that OpenEyeSim is a useful platform for studying many of the complexities of oculomotor control and learning during normal and abnormal visual development.",

        "text": "The locus of expression of synaptic plasticity has been hotly debated for decades (Padamsey and Emptage, 2014) . It is now clear that synaptic plasticity can be both pre- and postsynaptically expressed. Yet the functional role of this segregation remains entirely mysterious. Although it is known that long and short-term synaptic plasticity interact (Sjöström et al, 2003, 2007), most accounts treat these forms of plasticity independently. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that unifies pre- and postsynaptic components.\nOur unified STDP model captures the co-variation of short and long-term plasticity while being consistent with a wide range of experimental results. We find that the locus of expression — as determined by Coefficient of Variation analysis — depends on the timing and frequency of spiking. Functionally, unified STDP renders synapses more reliable and informative communication channels, as has been observed in vivo (Froemke et al, 2013). In addition, this learning rule implements a synaptic switch, which provides faster relearning of previously experienced stimuli, akin to memory savings theory (Ebbinghaus, 1885). Furthermore, a recurrent network governed by unified STDP yields synaptic dynamics that correlates with connectivity, and maintains a healthy firing regime even in the absence of homeostatic mechanisms. Finally, synapses in the network gradually shift from high to low release probability, similar to the widely observed shift of synaptic dynamics that occurs in development (Reyes and Sakmann, 1998), which suggests a potential causal relationship between unified STDP and maturation of synaptic release.\nTaken together, our results suggest that there is a tight link between synaptic dynamics, connectivity, and function. This unified STDP learning rule provides neuronal networks with attractive computational features and helps explain several synaptic properties in the intact brain.",

        "text": "The fMRI BOLD response to a spatially confined visual stimulus pattern extends over larger area on the primary visual cortex (V1) than could be expected from the receptive fields of individual neurons. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has been found to play a major role in linking the neuronal activity to the hemodynamic response. We sought to explain the distinct spatial tuning of the BOLD response and the neuronal spiking from the spatial spread of excitatory input to individual neurons on V1. While a neuron responds with spiking only to stimuli within its narrow receptive field, it receives modulatory input from much larger region of the input space. Due to dendritic filtering properties, the inputs landing on distal and proximal regions of a neuron’s dendritic tree have distinct effects on the spike frequency of the neurons. Our hypothesis was that modulatory (subthreshold) neural input activation from distal sites, landing on distal parts of the dendrites, may result in a large spatial spread of activation as measured in fMRI, while the neural spiking output is tightly confined to the simulated region.\nThis hypothesis was studied in a two-dimensional recurrent spiking neuronal network with spatially realistic extent of lateral and intracortical feedback connections. Each pyramidal V1 neuron consisted of multiple compartments. The distribution of synapses among the distal and proximal compartments was separately varied for different inputs. \nThe fMRI signal spread in the model, as proxied with the excitatory (glutamatergic) conductance, was commensurable with the fMRI response to a wedge oriented laterally along the horizontal meridian of the visual field. Supporting our hypothesis, a good fit to the data could be obtained only with nonisotropic landing of modulatory feedback to distal dendrites, when the requirement of the spiking response of the V1 neurons being limited to input within their narrow receptive fields was imposed.",

        "text": "Neurons of a given type exhibit variability in fine spatial features while, usually, their gross features remain relatively consistent. When comparing neuronal morphologies based on such spatial features, inconsistencies such as linear spatial shifts, rotations and scaling have to be taken into account. Here, we outline a preprocessing method to spatially align morphologies of neurons.  First, a set of morphological landmark features are identified which are consistent across the available set of morphologies. These landmark features are usually gross spatial features like a portion of a thick axon or a major branching point. Each morphology is then linearly transformed so that these landmark features align. We apply this preprocessing strategy to a set of 3-D reconstructed morphologies of a vibration sensitive neuron (DL-Int-1) in the honeybee which is assumed to play an important role in waggle dance communication (Ai et.al., 2009). We find that, post transformation, all other regions of the morphologies also align well, as indicated by the close clustering of the principal axes of these morphologies. When the same alignment procedure was applied to a different neuron with the same gross spatial features, we found the resulting principal axes to significantly differ from those of the former group. This suggests that our method could be used in the classification of neurons whose morphologies differ only in fine spatial features. This preprocessing method could also be useful in analyses where fine branches need to be spatially combined across samples to determine target projection areas of the neurons.",

        "text": "Scientific progress depends increasingly on collaborative efforts that involve exchange and re-analysis of previously recorded data. The German INCF Node (G-Node, www.g-node.org) aims at solutions for efficiently managing electrophysiological data and metadata, so that the researcher can focus on the scientific questions rather than on problems of data management.\nThe variety of data formats is a challenge in neurophysiology, and the Neuroshare API (neuroshare.org) is an attempt to unify data access. The G-Node Neuroshare Tools provide Python utilities to take full advantage of the Neuroshare API on various platforms [1]. To overcome the limitations of the Neuroshare standard in the long term, in the context of the INCF Data Sharing Program we are developing a common data format capable of integrating various types of neuroscientific data and metadata [2]. Efficient data selection for analysis requires that all metadata describing the experimental conditions are available with the data. The odML metadata format facilitates automated metadata capture and management and enables consistent data annotation [3]. odML Tools include libraries, a graphical editor, and an app for mobile devices for convenient metadata entry during the experiment [4]. The G-Node GNData platform [5] achieves integration of neurophysiological data and metadata by combining data representation according to the Neo data model for electrophysiology [6] with odML metadata. Programmatic data access is enabled by an API with client tools for popular frameworks (Matlab, Python) for seamless integration with the scientist's data analysis [7]. The G-Node data sharing services enable researchers to access their data from anywhere in the world and to share data with colleagues or the public. In addition, G-Node supports scientists in making resources and data available, by hosting databases, services, and published data, and offers training courses on a regular basis.",

Furthermore, when the area surrounding a target is cluttered, objects become even more difficult to identify and discriminate (\"crowding\"). We investigated the coding of position and orientation information by measuring human sensitivity to spatial distortions applied to letter stimuli. Spatial distortions offer a useful method to probe sensitivity to position and orientation because they can be applied to arbitrary images. Observers identified which of four peripherally-presented letters was distorted (4AFC task). We varied the amplitude and frequency characteristics of two band-limited distortion techniques: radial frequency distortion patterns [1] and bandpass noise distortion [2]. In a second condition, target letters were surrounded by four flanking letters to induce crowding. We characterise the change in sensitivity across the spatial scale of distortion for both distortion types and under crowded conditions.

        "text": "Spontaneous cortical activity -- the ongoing cortical activity in absence of intentional sensory input -- is considered to play a vital role in many aspects of brain functions. We use a Gaussian-binary Deep Boltzmann Machine (GDBM) for modeling the activity in early cortical visual areas and relate the random sampling in GDBMs to the spontaneous cortical activity. Our work demonstrates the GDBM is a meaningful model approach for basic receptive field properties and the emergence of spontaneous activity patterns in early cortical visual areas.\n\nAs an extension of a DBM[1] to real-value inputs, a GDBM is an undirected graph with units organized into layers. The inference in a (G)DBM incorporates both the top-down and the bottom-up messages, which gives (G)DBM an advantage in propagating the input uncertainties. \n\nAfter training a GDBM on natural image patches, we show that the samples collected from the model's probability distribution encompass similar activity patterns as found in the spontaneous activity[2]. Specifically, filters having the same orientation preference tend to be active together. \n\nWe collected the responses of the hidden units to the stimuli of grating bars. The average response over all the stimuli of each orientation was calculated and considered to be the model’s response to the specific orientation, which corresponds the single-condition orientation map (SCM). \n\nAfterwards, we sampled the states of the model starting from a random initialization. This procedure generated samples from the model’s distribution, which were considered as spontaneous frames (SFs). By calculating the spatial correlation coefficients between the SCMs and the SFs, we established the similarity between them.\n\nTo further verify the activity patterns in the spontaneous frames, we used SOM to project the SFs onto 40 nodes that were arranged on a circle. After training, the correlations between the weight vectors of the nodes and the SCMs support our hypothesis.",

        "text": "The axon initial segment (AIS) controls the transformation of dendrosomatic synaptic input into spike output and the backpropagation of action potentials into the dendrites due to its lower spike initiation threshold.  Channel density and kinetics can both contribute to this low threshold. However, the nature of such threshold differences is unknown and topic of current debates.\n\nDynamical response properties give a constraint on the AIS function. Here we study the dynamical response properties of multi compartment models with different levels of anatomical and biophysical detail. To study these properties, we inject Gaussian noise currents into the soma and its vary mean, variance and the correlation time $\\tau_I$. We then calculate the dynamic firing rate response of a population of independent neurons. This is described at linear order by a filter function with frequency dependent gain as done by Higgs and Spain 2009.\n\nWe studied the frequency dependent gain function of the models to see whether they reproduce two experimental observations from cortical pyradmidal cells a) the high cut-off frequency in the range of 200 Hz  b) the increasing cut-off frequency for increasing $\\tau_I$ which we call the Brunel effect (Brunel, et al. 2001).\n\nTwo models were tested. 1) Fleidervish, et al. 2010, a detailed model that reproduces the sodium currents in the AIS and soma of pyramidal cells. 2) Brette 2013, a ball and stick model where action potential onset sharpness is a consequence of a decoupling of AIS voltage and somatic voltage beyond a bifurcation point.\n\nWe find that for 1) and 2) the gain function is dominated by a low pass filter around the membrane time constant. The influence of morphological and kinetic parameters on the high frequency tails is currently investigated. 2) is highly suited to study the influence of the decoupling bifurcation on the gain function.",

        "text": "In higher mammals' primary visual cortex, orientation selectivity of neurons is arranged in a spatially continuous fashion composing an orientation preference map (OPM) [1,2]. \n\nOPMs are aperiodic patterns containing topological defects named pinwheels, which were modelled by means of non-equilibrium pattern formation theory [3]. Cortical pinwheel statistics [4,5] are in good agreement with the pinwheel statistics of this model and only this model. Most intriguingly a pinwheel density of pi, which is consistent with the experimental value 3.14(6). Commonly, it is believed that neuronal activity mechanisms cause the formation of OPMs. Recent evidence for ocular dominance maps, however, indicates that precursors of maps might already be encoded genetically [5], which can also be reasoned by genetic assimilation [7].\n\nHere, we introduce an extension of the seminal model devised in [3]. Our extension models the development of OPMs from a genetic point of view. Long-range interactions, which are a prerequisite for stable OPMs formation, are modelled by retro- and anterograde axonal signalling. Local interactions are modelled with biologically plausible gene regulatory mechanisms. Our model shows that genetic features alone can shape the design of OPMs, while belonging to the same universality class and therefore exhibiting the same pinwheel statistics. This might cast doubt on the idea that neuronal activity alone shapes OPMs.",

        "text": "Neural systems show a wide variety of complex dynamics on different time scales. Specifically, on the short time scale of neuronal activations (ms-sec), several theoretical models demonstrate that complex transient dynamics enables neural circuits to process a broad range of nonlinear problems [1]. This approach, amongst others, is based on the inherent diversity (randomness) of neural systems. On the other hand, the slower mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (minutes to hours) adapt synaptic efficacies to form ordered structures as neural cell assemblies [2]. This type of dynamics is in stark contrast to the needed randomness of connectivity for transient dynamics. However, contrary to expectations, several theoretical studies show that synaptic plasticity enhances the performance of networks solving nonlinear problems [3-5].\nIn this study we analyze how and why synaptic plasticity supports the transient dynamics needed for solving nonlinear tasks.\nWe investigate a random neural ntwork with connections adapted by a generic combination of Hebbian plasticity and synaptic scaling [6,7]. A subset of neurons receives repeatedly a time-varying input and forms a cell assembly [7]. Further repetitions of the input lead to a gradual growth of the cell assembly by incorporating more neurons. In parallel, the network is required to compute a desired nonlinear version of the input. To test whether this computation is successful, the connections between the neurons of the network and a linear output neuron are adapted by a supervised learning algorithm [8]. Remarkably, the performance of the computation increases with the growth in size of the cell assembly. Thus, the slow, ordering dynamics of synaptic plasticity supports the computational capability of the fast transient by integrating more neurons and, therefore, more diversity into the computational system.\nOur work shows that both concepts are not mutually exclusive but they interact with each other in a positive way.",

        "text": "To relate the functionality of large-scale neural networks to the level of single cells, it is a key requisite to uncover the spike trains of a large number of simultaneously recorded neurons from extracellular recordings. Silicon-based arrays with thousands of electrodes allow to simultaneously image the electrical activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons at sub-cellular spatial and high temporal resolution.\nHowever, existing spike sorting algorithms are only practical for up to about 500 electrodes. Probabilistic and real-time methods do not work in unsupervised manner, as they need to be initialized with a traditional sorting. Furthermore, all algorithms are designed for a fixed number of electrodes.\n\nHere we propose a framework for spike sorting algorithms that deals with the unsupervised problem in the case of thousands of electrodes and makes use of the spatial information of dense 2D arrays. Regions of interest (ROIs) with boundaries adapted to the electrical image of single or multiple neurons are constructed automatically. All ROIs can be processed in parallel. Within each region of interest an upper bound for the number of neurons can be estimated from the local data matrix alone. We deploy a simple ICA based algorithm to solve the local spike sorting within ROIs. Redundantly identified units across different ROIs are fused by automatically identifying the best representative. An information theoretic measure is used to assess the isolation quality of units. The framework was implemented in MATLAB and includes a graphical user interface for semi-automatic post-processing and visualization.\n\nWe evaluated the framework with recorded and surrogate data (1141 neurons/mm$^2$, 4356 sensors, 27 % spatiotemporally overlapping spikes). 81% of all ground truth units could be identified with error rates below 2%. In conclusion, we provide the first tool to solve the unsupervised spike sorting problem for data from thousands of densely intergrated sensors.",

        "text": "Path integration refers to the ability to navigate in an environment using self-motion cues derived from the vestibular and proprioceptive systems. This form of navigation depends on a near continuous estimation of the distance and direction of movement, and is especially important when reliable external landmarks are absent. Because of the iterative nature of path integration, error in the calculation of position is cumulative.\nThe directional component of path integration likely depends on the activity of head-direction (HD) cells. HD cells fire when the animal's head points in a specific direction, independently of the behavior or location of the animal. Here we developed a protocol to investigate how error accumulates in the activity of HD cells during path integration. We performed in vivo multiple single-unit recordings of HD cells from the anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus of behaving mice. The mice were trained to run on a circular platform during 30 2-min trials. In half of the trials, one light source located at the periphery of the platform was turned on. The remaining trials were performed in darkness. During some recording sessions, the surface of the platform was covered with water to eliminate olfactory cues.\nPreliminary results showed that the tuning curves of HD cells were wider during trials performed in  darkness. Moreover, the selectivity of HD cells deteriorated progressively within the 2-min trials in the dark, consistent with the hypothesis that error accumulates in the HD system during path integration. We now plan to investigate which behavioral variables (path length, number of head turns, time elapsed, etc.) contribute to the accumulation of error in the activity of these neurons.\n",

        "text": "The superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) contain a variety of spatially selective cell types that are thought to generate a metric representation of space. A prominent cell type there are grid cells that exhibit a regular, hexagonal firing pattern when an animal runs in an open environment. Anatomically, excitatory neurons in the MEC show a high degree of variability ranging from stellate cells to pyramidal cells, and including several intermediate types. Here we investigated whether principal neurons recorded extracellularly in the superficial layers of the MEC can be separated into distinct groups based on their spike patterns at a millisecond time scale. Cluster analysis of spike-time autocorrelations revealed at least two groups, labelled bursty and non-bursty neurons, which also exhibit different spike waveforms. Bursty neurons were twice as likely to be classified as grid cells compared to non-bursty neurons. Moreover, 70% of the detected monosynaptic excitatory connections between principal cells and interneurons originate from bursty neurons. Together, these results suggest that bursty and non-bursty neurons form distinct neuronal populations differing in biophysical properties and network functions.  \n",

        "text": "The widespread use of neuromodulation by nervous systems presents several important computational consequences which are often ignored by computer models. Somehow these circuits must preclude dysfunctional states but at the same time remain flexible and robust.\nThe activity of the central pattern generating pyloric circuit is known to be influenced by several chemicals including dopamine which acts by differentially modulating the intrinsic cellular (ionic currents) and synaptic properties of each neuron. To date, experimentalists have accumulated a considerable body of evidence detailing dopamine’s effect on each kinetic and voltage sensitive parameter of the circuit but lack a unified conceptual framework for studying these effects systematically. One approach is to embody the experimental data in a highly detailed computer model and use this as a bridge to establish a link between the low level cellular and synaptic changes and the higher level systems dynamics and functionality. Through this prism, the underlying mechanisms of neuromodulatory control can be unravelled. This study uses once such model to access the impact of dopamine on the phase, frequency and synchronisation of the pyloric circuit.\nHere, dopamine was found to advance or delay the phase of each neuron by differentially modulating each cell’s complement of ionic currents in a manner consistent with in vivo observations. In agreement with dynamic clamp experiments, the models phase response diagram indicated that early synaptic inhibition onto PD decreased the circuit’s frequency and late synaptic inhibition enhanced it. The dopamine enhanced PD to AB electrical coupling accounted for the observed decline in circuit frequency, with stronger coupling promoting lower frequencies and vice versa. The dopamine induced disruption of PY electrical coupling was quantified in terms of slow wave plateaux and rapid spiking synchrony using the spike distance metric.",

We have collected an extensive dataset of 388 subjects, which consists of eyes open and eyes closed resting state EEG recordings (32 active electrodes) together with five factor personality scores. Validated questionnaires were used to assess five personality traits, which are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. \nAfter artefact rejection and computation of power spectra, we use a half of the data to find the best technique for predicting the personality scores and then we test the true accuracy of the prediction on the other half of the data.\nIn particular, we use a 10-fold cross-validation for a half of the data in order to find the best combination of hyper-parameters for machine learning where a predictive model is trained in order to classify previously unseen data points. We tested different techniques to pre-process the data by normalizing, pooling and reducing dimensions; we also use different machine learning algorithms (linear and non-linear support vector machines) with different parameters.\nThe accuracy of the best model is estimated on the other half of the data using leave-one-out cross-testing. \nThe procedure was also validated on the task of classifying eyes open and eyes closed trials where the cross-testing resulted an error of $10\\%$ ($p<10^{-60}$).",

        "text": "Lamination is a landmark feature of cortical architecture but the role played by interlayer connections in shaping the dynamical responses of a cortical column has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyze a mean-field model of a cortical column with realistic interlayer connections (the one-column \"connectome\" of Binzegger & al. 2004). Systematically varying efficacy of excitation and inhibition in the model we find phase diagrams showing a great diversity of possible dynamical regimes. Due to the presence of delayed inhibition and the interaction of layers, oscillations can be generated. Oscillations in different layers may be phase-locked or phase-precessing and have different frequencies. For some parameters high frequencies (gamma-like) predominate in L23 while low beta-like frequencies predominate in L5. Remarkably, while this experimentally observed tendency is usually attributed to the different cortical sources to different layers, here it arises spontaneously in an isolated model column, resulting from the multilayer connectivity. The column is thus intrinsically predisposed to communication-through-coherence processes over multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, we find that horizontal or top-down currents, mediating context information, are non-linearly amplified and that vertical inter-layer interactions alone already contribute to contextual modulations of the column response, besides other interactions not explicitly modeled. Our model predicts inter-layer competition behaviors which could be probed experimentally by selective optogenetic (in)activation techniques. The robustness of our findings is discussed by comparison with alternative wiring diagrams. We plan to use our multi-layer model to provide a neural mass description of the activity of local brain regions in a whole-brain scale network model, exploring the self-organized emergence of multi-frequency coherence networks and their role in attentional modulation of functional connectivity.",

It has been hypothesized that the particular phase relationship between the rhythms of the pertinent areas, allows for a window of directed and precise communication. This hypothesis, known as communication through coherence, provides a framework to understand the mechanisms that mediate fast, flexible and precisely targeted switching between communication pathways. \nMuch of the experimental work aimed to show inter-areal coherence or phase coherence  in a context of assumed communication, but a thorough analysis of a suitable measure for quantifying the inter-areal information flow (communication), in a framework of controlled phase relationship has not yet been achieved. \nIn this work we investigated through a mechanistic modeling how small motifs of two interacting local populations of conductance-based inhibitory and excitatory neurons connected by long range excitation, set their population mean activity in temporally-restricted synchrony-regulated hierarchical configuration (leader-laggard), despite symmetry and reciprocity of structural connections between them.\nWe show that the information flow between them, as measured with transfer entropy, is determined by this dynamics. In a model with an output comparable in its synchronization level and statistics with Local Field Potential signals of in vivo recordings, we show that the direction of the information flow is defined by the phase relationship, and that the effective directionality can be uni or bi-directional depending on the level of long range excitation and the synchrony of the system, but always following the structure introduced by the phase dynamics. \n \n",

These devices offer thus novel capabilities to investigate the interplay between ongoing and evoked electrophysiological signaling within networks in-vitro. However, to effectively take advantage from the spatiotemporal resolution of these MEAs, adapted analysis tools are needed. Here we report on our recent advancements toward this goal. A novel high density MEA with on-chip stimulating electrodes was used to record from 4096 electrodes and electrical stimulation was delivered alternatively through one of the 16 equally spaced electrodes on hippocampal primary cultures. From the second week in vitro these cultures display synchronous like events, also called synchronous burst events (SBEs), propagating across the entire network. Notably, these propagations are quite stable along time and emerge in a random fashion from few specific sites of the network. Former attempts in classifying SBEs considered simplified descriptors of neural activity (e.g. center activity trajectory [2]) while here we have adopted a more rigorous approach by applying dimensional reduction techniques (PCA) that takes advantage of the robustness (i.e. high signal to noise ratio) and reproducibility of the cell culture recordings. Interestingly, the PCA classification allowed us to characterize both intrinsic and electrically evoked network-wide SBE propagations with only few PC components (see Fig.1). The PCA methodology also allowed us to finely track the changes of activity in cell cultures treated with synaptic blockers.",

Recent\nobservations suggest that the increase in spatial scale is accompanied by an\nincrease in temporal scale, with neurons in higher areas showing slower\ndynamics [1]. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms are not un-\nderstood. We explored the hypothesis that variation of ion channel expression\nacross cortical areas determines the change in temporal dynamics of the corre-\nsponding neural circuits. We analyzed the freely accessible set of microarray and\nRNA-sequencing transcriptome data on human brains, provided by the Allen\nBrain Atlas [2]. We tested a set of 70 ion channel-related genes for changes\nin expression across the dorsal visual stream. The dataset encompasses genes\ncoding for the α-subunits of voltage-gated sodium-, potassium-, calcium- and\nhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, as well\nas ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors (AMPA-, NMDA- and GABA-\nreceptors). After testing for differential expression across lobes, we used single-\ncompartment Hodgkin-Huxley models to assess how the resulting subset of chan-\nnels influences the timescale of neural dynamics. Preliminary results suggest\nthat the change of temporal scale across cortical regions is not due to variations\nin ion channel expression, but the result of network effects.\n",

        "text": "Sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), transient episodes of neural activity combining a sharp wave of dendritic depolarization and a high-frequency oscillation, are a major feature of the cortico-hippocampal communication. Experimental evidence relates these episodes to offline consolidation of memory traces. However, the circuitry dynamics that governs these episodes remains poorly understood. Using multi-site extracellular recordings of the hippocampal CA1, we have previously provided evidence for the existence of differentiated SPW-Rs, whose LFP signatures come in four types that suggest a dynamical coupling between SPWs and ripples[1] (Figure 1a).\n\nHere we develop a methodology to extract dynamical components from peri-event activity of the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) and stratum pyramidale (PL). We hypothesize that SPW-Rs can be approximated by an instantaneous linear superposition of independent sources with different spectral signatures that account for their dynamics. Inspired by the second order blind identification (SOBI) algorithm[2], our approach estimates the spatial spread and spectral signature of these dynamical sources by implementing a Joint Approximate Diagonalization of the cross-spectral density matrix between recording sites.\n\nOur analysis reveals that dynamical components with distinct spatial signature can be isolated: a broad-band-spectrum component spanning the gamma and ripple bands, originates in SR; and a second component, with clear spectral peak in the ripple band (80-200Hz), originates in PL (Figure 1b c). Differences between SPW-R subtypes are reflected in the spectra of the second component (ripple). We suggest that differences between SPW-Rs are related to local recurrent dynamics within PL, endowing both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our preliminary findings illustrate the convenience of our approach for extracting meaningful dynamical components from multi-site LFPs during neuronal events and for unraveling their underlying mechanisms.",

        "text": "The study of saliency, here defined as a spatial combination of image features that can capture fixation patterns, is important for both human perception and for computer vision research. However, human fixations are not only determined by the image presented on the screen but also by myriad behavioural biases, including a tendency to look at the centre of the screen and mechanistic temporal effects [1]. The influence of these biases is large [2] and strongly task dependent [3]. Any comparison of saliency models must take these biases into account. \n\nHere we separate the contribution of image-based saliency and several behavioural biases using a probabalistic framework and information theoretic evaluation. We compare several prominent saliency models to a nonparametric gold standard, in which we capture all the spatial structure that can be explained in the data set. We model fixations using point processes [4], and compare models using mutual information. Using a popular data set [5], we show that the total amount of mutual information that can be extracted from an image about the spatial structure of fixations is 2.1 bits/fixation. The best performing model explains 59% of this total information. Remarkably, a model that ignores image content altogether but captures the observers' centre bias explains 42% of the total information. Once the effect of spatial behavioural biases are removed, saliency models explain only 29% of the mutual information. Thus, purely spatial saliency remains a significant challenge.\n\nFinally, we extend the point process framework to capture temporal dependencies between eye movements, revealing that including a tendency to fixate near to the previous fixation [see also 6] increases the likelihood by more than the best saliency models. If we are interested in understanding how people look at images, focusing on only spatial information ignores important structure that is easily accounted for.",

Although theoretical and experimental studies have provided some insights regarding the mechanisms of how the brain acquires, represents and stores information, a comprehensive theory of the brain and the underlying neural information processing is still missing. Experimental techniques to study brain processes on different levels of description, notably the sub-neuron (synaptic, dendritic and axonal), single neuron and neural network level, are therefore of fundamental importance for brain research. Recently, a new promising technique in solid state physics has emerged for measuring electric and magnetic fields at the nanometer scale with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (sub-micron and sub-ms range). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond is a unique ultra-sensitive quantum device that can sense external magnetic and electrical fields via its spin states, which can be read-out optically using electron spin resonances. I will present the efforts undertaken in the NeuronQ project that combines both disciplines, brain research and quantum technology, in a multidisciplinary research effort and aims towards the development of an NV center based neuroimaging system for real-time recording of neural activity on the sub-neuron, neuron and neuron network level under ambient conditions.",

        "text": "The neural principles by which vibrotactile frequencies are encoded, memorized, and compared have been well studied in monkeys (reviewed in [2]). More recently, neural correlates for the working-memory aspects of these processes were also identified in human oscillatory EEG activity (cf. [3, 4]). The goal of the present study was to extend these findings by characterizing to what degree comparisons between vibrotactile frequencies may be reflected in the time-frequency spectrum of human EEG recordings.\nWe asked 21 participants during EEG acquisition to indicate which of two sequentially presented brief vibrotactile stimuli (f1 and f2) was higher in frequency. Single-trial time-frequency maps were analysed to identify correlations of stimulus frequency differences with power changes of the whole frequency spectrum over time.\nAfter the presentation of f2, we found the power of beta-band activity (~15 – 30 Hz) recorded over medial prefrontal and lateral parietal areas to reflect the emergence of the upcoming decision. Crucially, the beta-band power was modulated by the signed frequency differences of the stimuli before responses were given. This modulation exhibited a characteristic spatio-temporal trajectory (from prefrontal to parietal electrodes), and was localized to sources of the premotor areas and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices.\nIn sum, we show that decision-related signals that were previously only recorded invasively in non-human primates can also be captured with non-invasive EEG recordings. Given the exhaustive empirical evidence that describes the involved neural processes on a microscopic (cf. [2]) and mesoscopic [1] level in monkeys, the frequency comparison task might serve as an exciting new framework to study perceptual decision-making in humans. Moreover, the paradigm seems to be eligible to investigate how neural processes can bridge the scales from microscopic single neuron activity to the systems level.",

        "text": "Neural field models (NFMs) provide an alternative to networks of enumerable neurons by describing the collective activity of neural ensembles as excitations of a continuous medium [1]. NFMs are a natural match for the extended and coherent dendritic activations driving local field potentials (LFPs), and thus the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, so far NFMs have typically collapsed the radial dimension of cortex with its intricate layer structure, describing instead a 2D cortical sheet. This corresponds to assuming point neurons, even where different neural ensembles are supposed to reside in different layers [2], since there is then no explicit representation of the spatial extent of the dendrites. However, dendritic trees of single neurons play a fundamental role in synaptic integration and the generation of EEG signals [3], and incorporating diffusive dendritic structure can change NFM dynamics [4].\nWe implement here a 3D cortical NFM, i.e., we include a spatially extended dendritic dimension in the neural field dynamics. Our starting point is a well-known 2D NFM [5-7]. We explain which biological hypotheses and mathematical approximations are necessary to introduce dendritic properties to this NFM, and demonstrate software capable of simulating the resulting set of equations. We then investigate the influence of dendritic properties, such as the synaptic connectivity and their distribution in the dendritic trees [8], in order to understand the effect of local circuitry. Finally, we provide an outlook on comparing such 3D-NFMs with recordings from epileptic tissue before and after pharmacological treatments. While we focus here on a specific model, the techniques and methods used generalise to any chosen NFM. We expect that 3D-NFMs will become the method of choice for many applications, due to their ability to incorporate experimental data on microcircuitry and their direct applicability to depth electrode recordings. \n",

        "text": "During an epileptic seizure a wave of population activity is moving through neural tissue. To understand its development it is crucial to know whether or not the neurons are going to be recruited into the wave. We derive an indirect indication for how easy it would be for the neurons to be recruited, by estimating their entrainment ability to periodic pulsatile stimulus, and how the entrainment ability is modified when intrinsic properties of the cell are altered, particularly properties of the currents that have been implicated in certain kinds of epilepsy.\n\nIn this study we investigate the effects of periodic stimulation on two (noisy) neuron models: including an M-type potassium and a hyperpolarizing cation (H-) current, respectively. The (over/under)-expression of these channels has been associated with epileptogenesis. Varying the maximal conductances of the M- and H-currents qualitatively changes the shape and magnitude of the model neurons’ phase resetting curves (PRCs).\n\nWe begin by representing the neurons by their noisy phase resetting curves (PRCs). From these data we create stochastic phase map, taking careful account of the possibility of multiple inputs per cycle. The stochastic phase map takes phase of a spike relative to the periodic stimulus and maps it to the phase of the subsequent spike. We compute and analyze the spectrum of the Markov transition operator for this stochastic circle map. Pathwise dynamic properties, such as stochastic periodicity (phase-locking), stochastic quasi-periodicity, and chaotic behavior, can be distinguished using the geometry of the transition operator’s spectrum [1]. As a result, a measure of neuron's ability to entrain is obtained.\n\nThe procedure is repeated for a number of parameter combinations (M- or H- current maximal conductance, noise level, stimulus strength, stimulus frequency) to explore the dependence of the phase maps’ spectral properties (and resulting entrainability) on intrinsic and input parameters.",

        "text": "Brian 2 is a fundamental rewrite of the Brian [1,2] simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python programming language and focuses on simplicity and extensibility: neuronal and synaptic models can be described using mathematical formulae and with the use of physical units[3]. The same formalism can also be used to specify connectivity patterns (e.g. spatial connectivity), using mathematical expressions to define connections, probabilities of connections, number of synapses between neurons, and synaptic delays.\nBrian 2 offers two modes of operation: a “runtime mode”, where executable code is generated from the model descriptions on the fly and executed from Python and a “standalone mode”, where a set of source code files is generated that can then be compiled and executed with no dependency on Brian or Python. The runtime mode is ideal for rapid prototyping and interactive exploration, e.g. from a Python console. The standalone mode on the other hand is designed for maximum of performance and for simulating models on a variety of hardware and platforms.\nWe show a number of example applications for the standalone mode, generating code for a wide range of devices:\n- C++ code that is completely independent of Brian, Python or Python libraries. Optionally, this code can be parallelized over multiple CPU cores using the OpenMP libraries.\n- Java/Renderscript for Android-based devices, enabling Brian to run neural models on commodity hardware (e.g. phones) for robotic applications[5].\n- The GPU enhanced Neuronal Networks (GeNN) framework[6,7], a neural simulator using GPUs to accelerate neural simulations.\n- The same approach would also allow the generation of code targeted at neuromorphic computing architectures such as the SpiNNaker platform[8] for which we have started preliminary work.\nBrian is made available under a free software license and all development takes place in public code repositories [9].",

        "text": "Understanding neural dynamics requires network models which are physiologically valid yet at the same time analytically tractable. On the one hand, there are biologically realistic neural networks which often lack systematic insights into the underlying dynamics. Moreover, these time-consuming network simulations often fail to link single neuron properties with the network level, which is highly desirable to achieve a deeper understanding of physiological and functional correlations. On the other hand, mean-field networks (MFN) of very simple neuron models are too removed from the reality to address detailed questions about physiology. Thus, MFN based on physiologically realistic yet at the same time mathematically tractable neuron models may be an important step towards this goal. \nHere, we extend the theory of MFN by computing the firing rate of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron (AdEx) with spike-triggered adaptation in the presence of Gaussian synaptic noise. Despite the just two dimensions and a handful of parameters, the AdEx can reproduce plenty of spiking patterns observed in-vitro [1]. Hence, it presents an excellent compromise between Hodgkin-Huxley like neuron models and very simple leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (IF) [2]. For computing the firing rate, we use two approaches: 1) We solve the full 2D Fokker-Planck equation (FP) that describes the probability distribution of the membrane potential V and an adaptation current w. 2) We retrieve the solution of the FP of the exponential IF by incorporating w by either its mean or distribution. All approaches were tested with simulations and show a remarkable agreement for different neuron types and layers from the rodent mPFC. Extensions of the equations to incorporate synaptic kinetics, and results for a MFN based on AdEx neurons are also provided. Hence, the present work provides one of the central steps for analytically tractable MF approaches of physiologically realistic model networks",

        "text": "A large body of experimental evidence shows that place cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus generate temporal sequential activity during sleep or immobility awake states. Some of these sequences have been shown to correlate with the previous (replay) or the future (preplay) spatial ordering of the corresponding place fields. Because of the abundant recurrent connections, these sequences are thought to originate in CA3 and trigger neuronal sequences downstream, e.g., in CA1. We previously showed that a continuous attractor model for the CA3 network can reliably generate long neuronal sequences (Azizi et al., 2013)⁠. These sequences were generated as a result of bump of activity moving through a preconfigured multi-chart network. Here we extend on this work by incorporating plasticity in the network and studying replay and preplay in CA1. First, we studied how learning in the recurrent connections of the network would affect movement dynamics of the bump. The weights were changed according to non-linear temporally asymmetric Hebbian protocol (Gütig et al., 2003) $$W = dW_p W_{max} + W(1-dW_p)^\\mu,$$ for potentiation and $$W = W(1-dW_d)^\\mu$$ for depression. The weights change according to $$dW_s = a_se^{\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_s}},$$ in which s = p for potentiation, and s = d for depression. We found that despite the potentially destabilizing effect of synaptic plasticity, a parameter regime can be found in which a bump of activity forms and moves across the networkin one of the charts Figure 1A. This behavior can account for preplay.\nSecond, we examined the plausibility of the assumption that sequential activity can be transferred from CA3 to CA1 via random feedforward connections. We found significant preplay sequences in the CA1 region for both plastic and rigid connecting weights Figure 1B.\nIn summary, our results show that stable sequences can originate in a continuous attractor network model of CA3 with plastic synapses, and propagate to CA1.",

        "text": "Experimental studies have found that episodic memory in humans is unreliable, often preserving little more than the gist of the experienced episode, but none of the details. We hypothesize that this property of the episodic memory system results from the fact that episodes are stored only in terms of higher order information, i.e., semantic representation, not their underlying sensory inputs.  This hypothesis is similar to Tulving's SPI (Serial-Parallel-Independent) model (Tulving, 1995), in which sensory information is first processed by the semantic system before being stored in the episodic system. Here, we use a computational model to study the interrelation between the semantic and episodic system. In our model, the semantic system is trained by an algorithm called slow feature analysis (SFA) that extracts slowly-varying features from time-varying sensory inputs (Wiskott and Sejnowski, 2002). The semantic system thus compresses the high-dimensional sensory inputs to a lower dimensionality both in space and time, i.e., the semantic representation can be represented by fewer neurons and varies at a lower rate than the sensory input stream. In our model, episodic memories are represented as sequences of semantic representations, which are stored in and retrieved from a memory network. We examine how the quality of episodic memory retrieval is affected by prior semantic knowledge about the content of the episode. We first train two semantic networks each on different objects. Then we store and retrieve episodes containing either the same or the other object. Thus, episodic memory is based either on an appropriate or inappropriate semantic representation, respectively. Our results indicate that episodic memory is more accurate if the underlying semantic representation has been optimized for the object that is being stored in episodic memory, suggesting that the semantic representation plays an important role in episodic memory.",

Depending on the correlations between such different sensory cues, the resulting alignment can shape multisensory organization and processing simultaneously at both, structural and functional levels [2]. In this work we present a model of multisensory development, which learns correlations between different sensory streams, by enhancing the interaction between strongly correlated cues and weakening the interaction between uncorrelated cues. Combining Self-Organizing-Maps, to represent sensory data, and Hebbian Learning, to support correlated co-activation in each map, our model demonstrates enhancement and suppression of interactions between sensory cues as shown in [3]. This learning scheme, which combines local cooperation and competition at map level with adaptive interactions between maps, is suitable to model the developmental process of multimodal interactions. The resulting connectivity pattern between maps encodes the correlation between sensory cues (e.g. a mapping from one cue to another) and can be used in the integration process. The proposed model is attractive for robotics applications in which sensor fusion schemes are usually hand crafted and dedicated to particular scenarios; thereby lacking flexibility and adaptation to new settings. The inherent learning/adaptation capabilities make the proposed model a promising candidate for sensor fusion applications targeting real-time robotics.",

        "text": "A key requirement for any system, including biological or man-made systems, is their ability to estimate physical properties of the real world through uncertain and partially reliable observations, to properly interact with their environment. The human brain can combine such noisy and partially reliable pieces of information to optimally estimate the state of the world and to consequently handle cognitive tasks efficiently [1]. Sensory cues do not have equal distributions of reliability over sensory space [2]. A less investigated issue in multi-sensory integration is how to encode and learn reliability of cues into spatially registered form of neural activity. In this work, we suggest a recurrent attractor network capable of learning arbitrary relations between one of the encoded sensory variables as a function of other variables using Hebbian Learning. In another point of view the attraction surface of the network’s dynamics is the same surface of the relation function through which the network realizes a relation satisfaction. We demonstrate that after constructing plastic weights, the network is able to perform inference and reasoning, de-noising, reliability based cue-integration and decision making [3]. This framework is well scalable for scenarios with higher order of modalities with acceptable flexibility to a wide range of smooth functions. Another important feature of the network is the possibility of spatially distributed reliability representations in form of neural activity. In fact, we can strengthen the encoded activity of stimuli according to their relative reliability; so that the network converges to the point on the relation surface closest to the initial points of more reliable cues. This reliability-based encoding biases the network’s dynamics in favor of more reliable cues, and realizes a near optimal sensory integration mechanism. To evaluate proposed network a multi-modal weighted cuing for a realistic heading estimation scenario is presented.",

        "text": "We present a novel method for implementing Factor Graphs in a SpiNNaker Neural Computing System. The SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network Architecture) framework is a distributed computing system designed to simulate large spiking neural networks in real-time [1]. It is composed of multiple SpiNNaker chips in a toroidal network, allowing the simulation of thousands of artificial spiking neurons in real time. In this work however, we do not use SpiNNaker’s native mechanisms; but instead we use the abundant resources to implement population coding principles over a fully connected homogenous network for a different application: computing believe propagation on a Factor Graph [2]. We present a framework which utilizes available SpiNNaker resources to implement a discrete Factor Graph (FG); a graphical model for probabilistic inference. In a FG, each variable represents the current belief about a specific dynamic system's state, and exchanges information by sending messages to each other, to update the overall belief. In our view, this mechanism resembles brain style information processing, where overall performance emerges from concurrently communicating local computation of many individual units.\nIn this work we implement a FG on a SpiNNaker computing system and demonstrate its promising performance, especially compared against a PC-based implementation. Note that conventional PCs are particularly poor hardware matches to instantiate such distributed graphical networks. Our framework allows mapping and routing a FG on the SpiNNaker hardware using SpiNNaker’s event-based communication system. We provide an example application of the proposed framework in a real-world robotics scenario, resulting in 26.14 MFLOPS computation in only 30.5ms. We demonstrate that the framework seamlessly extends to map larger FG networks onto bigger SpiNNaker systems; turning it suitable for complex and challenging real-time cognitive intelligence tasks.",

        "text": "Autonomous mobile robots need to incorporate a significant number of sensors to reliably plan and securely follow trajectories in partially unknown or dynamically changing environments. Rodents, in contrast, navigate remarkably well with a limited number of sensors, outperforming state-of-the-art engineered systems in terms of adaptability and employed computing resources. Consequently, the recent discovery of grid cells in the Entorhinal Cortex, assumed to perform path integration (Hafting et al. 2005), and of the pre-play of future Place Cells (Pfeiffer 2013) raise the question if understanding these mechanisms helps to improve navigation for autonomous robots.\n\nA basic mechanism that is still not properly understood is grid realignment. The periodic spatial response of grid cells changes when place cells undergo remapping, which itself indicates a significant change in the animal’s environment. As the grid cells are one synapse upstream, they are assumed to be one source of inputs to place cells, and thus the cause for such remapping (Monaco 2011).\n\nOn the one hand, we assume that imposing a grid orientation based on visual cues is a key source of realignment. On the other hand, we assume that realignment itself is crucial to translate idiothetic motion information into a reliable allothetic path. In this work we demonstrate a model which is able to compensate for different idiothetic head direction estimates and compute an allothetic path integral. We adapted a recently published model (Couey et al. 2013) to incorporate various such idiothetic signals and validated the performance using simulations of virtual rats, closely resembling the movement statistics of real rodents.\n\nThe required connectivity from head direction cells to grid cells can be acquired using Hebbian Learning. The integration of different velocity inputs in the grid cell network may help to understand the parallel conduction of sensory integration and alignment for robotic real-world systems.",

        "text": "The orienting response is an organism’s reaction to changes in its environment. It includes changes in gaze, attention, pupil dilation, and head-orienting circuits, in order to heighten perception and prepare for action. The frontal eye fields (FEF) are a part of the oculomotor system, and are known to be involved in the generation of voluntary saccadic eye movements and covert shifts in visuo-spatial attention. While microstimulation of the FEF can evoke saccadic gaze shifts, lower levels of stimulation current can evoke components of the orienting response, such as covert shifts in attention or neck muscle responses, without saccades. Based on recent results showing that pupil dilation can be evoked by such subsaccadic stimulation of the superior colliculus in primates or optic tectum of owls, we investigated the effects of subsaccadic FEF microstimulation on pupil dilation. A non-human primate performed a gap saccade task with a variable fixation epoch, in which we stimulated the right FEF with biphasic pulses (200ms, 300Hz). Pupil diameter of the left eye, as well as EMG activity in head turning neck muscles were measured throughout the task. In blocks of stimulation currents from 5-60 µA, we were able to evoke contralateral saccades ranging from 5-20° as well as saccadic and subsaccadic neck EMG responses. For subsaccadic stimulation trials, we found an increase in pupil dilation after stimulation, starting 200-250ms after stimulation onset. In addition, the level of the induced pupil response was positively correlated with increasing stimulation currents that were still below saccade threshold. Such increases were in line with the magnitude of evoked neck muscle activity. Our results imply a contribution of FEF to pupil dilation, presumably mediated through the superior colliculus. This suggests a potential substrate for linking high-level cognitive states to pupil dilation.",

        "text": "Auditory stream segregation is the process whereby a complex sound mixture is perceptually partitioned into ‘streams’ that ideally reflect the individual signals making up the mixture. Signal elements that contain similar properties are typically grouped into the same stream while elements with different properties are assigned to different streams. Differences in each signal between the ears (binaural cues) provide one such set of properties, which are particularly valuable to unimpaired listeners when competing signals do not directly overlap in time (sequential segregation). The present study psychophysically investigated whether bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) users can achieve similar sequential segregation benefits from binaural cues.\n\nSix BiCI users were presented sequences of alternating ‘A’ and ‘B’ bursts that had either a ‘regular’ uniform timing structure, or an ‘irregular structure that was generated by applying delays to each ‘B’ burst of the regular sequence. 'B' burst delay thresholds that enabled rhythm irregularity detection were determined. The task was assumed to be more difficult if ‘A’ and ‘B’ were perceived as part of different streams. Therefore high thresholds were assumed to reflect increased stream segregation.\n \n‘A’ was presented monaurally to a fixed mid-array electrode in the left ear. The ear of stimulation for ‘B’ was varied to be ipsilateral or contralateral to ‘A’, or diotic. The electrode of ‘B’ was also varied across the array. Results showed that thresholds for all three ear conditions were significantly different, and were lowest for the ipsilateral condition and highest for contralateral case. For the ipsilateral condition, average delay thresholds also increased as electrode separation between ‘A’ and ‘B’ increased. The results from the present study indicate that differences both across and within ears can be used to promote sequential separation of multiple auditory streams in bilateral CI.",

        "text": "Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in field potential signals has received a great amount of attention recently. PAC represents the coupling between the power of high frequency oscillations (30-100 Hz) and the phase of low frequency oscillations (<12 Hz). However the measure by which it is calculated has some shortcomings.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to measure PAC among which the Modulation Index (MI) (Tort et al., 2010) and the Mean Vector Length (Canolty et al., 2006) are the most frequent used approaches. They both normalize the PAC calculated for real signals to the PAC calculated by disrupting any phase relationship between low and high frequency oscillations. This is based on the assumption that random noise signals contain no PAC. We found this assumption incorrect and therefore propose a correction in the normalization process.\nWe calculated the probability distribution function (PDF) of the high frequency power (100-120 Hz) relative to the low frequency phase (5-13 Hz) in a large number of white noise signals. The resulting PDF was not uniform, i.e. there was a significant difference between the peak and trough of the PDF (p<<0.01). Therefore we propose a correction: in order to normalize the PAC value for a given real signal, one should first calculate the distribution of PAC values for a large number of random signals with the same length as the original signal and then normalize the real signal’s PAC to the distribution of random signals’ PACs using z-scoring.\nWe applied this new Coupling Index (CI) to a series of noise signals. The result did not contain any significant difference with 0 (p>0.05) suggesting that the new measure controls for any default PAC existing in real signals. However applying the original MI on noise signals leaded to values significantly greater than 0 (p<<0.01).\nWe proposed a new method for calculating PAC that allows to measure the physiological component of PAC by controlling for any PAC that is found in noise signals.\n",

        "text": "Neural-network models of brain function often rely on the presence of noise [1,2]. To date, the biological origin of this noise remains unclear. In computer simulations and in neuromorphic hardware [3,4], the number of noise sources (random-number generators) is limited. In consequence, neurons in large functional network models have to share noise sources and are therefore correlated. In general, it is unclear how shared-noise correlations affect the performance of functional network models. Further, there is so far no solution to the problem of how a limited number of noise sources can supply a large number of functional units with uncorrelated noise.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that the performance of two functional architectures, attractor networks [5] and neural Boltzmann machines [2], is substantially impaired by shared-noise correlations resulting from the finite size of the ensemble of noise sources. Further, we show that this problem can be overcome by replacing the finite ensemble of independent noise sources by a (finite) recurrent neural network. As shown recently, inhibitory feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, serves as a powerful decorrelation mechanism [6,7]: Shared-noise correlations are actively suppressed by the network dynamics. By exploiting this effect, the network performance is significantly improved. Hence, recurrent neural networks can serve as natural finite-size noise sources for functional neural networks, both in biological and in synthetic neuromorphic substrates.\n\nAcknowledgments: Partially supported by the Helmholtz Association portfolio theme SMHB, the Jülich Aachen Research Alliance (JARA), EU Grant 269921 (BrainScaleS), The Austrian Science Fund FWF #I753-N23 (PNEUMA), The Manfred Stärk Foundation, and EU Grant 604102 (Human Brain Project, HBP).",

        "text": "The theory of correlations in asynchronous networks of identical randomly connected neurons has been previously developed for both binary and spiking networks [1,2,3,4,5]. The theory for binary networks without delays predicts that, given mean activities and population sizes, average pairwise correlations are uniquely determined by the population-level effective connectivity matrix. Thus, diagonalizable effective connectivity matrices can in principle be reconstructed from the correlations [6]. Here, effective connectivity is the product of structural connectivity and susceptibility, which depends on the mean and variance of inputs. We show that under certain conditions a one-to-one relationship between effective connectivity and correlations also exists for networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with exponential current-based synapses and delayed couplings. We verify theoretical predictions for both binary and spiking networks using NEST [7] simulations.\n\nOur findings have implications for network scaling, i.e., the reduction in neuron and synapse numbers that is often performed to ease the computational burden of simulations. Correlation sizes scale inversely to network size, but their shape and population structure may be preserved. If these properties are important for the phenomena considered, e.g., in studies of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, the effective connectivity matrix should be invariant under downscaling. If neuronal susceptibility is unaltered, this means that synaptic weights must be inversely proportional to in-degrees. As stronger synapses increase the variance of intrinsic inputs, maintaining mean activities is achieved by reducing the variance of the external drive. This only works up to the point where the extrinsic variance vanishes, limiting the range of in-degrees and network sizes over which mean activities and correlation structure can simultaneously be preserved. Therefore, network size can only be reduced within narrow bounds.",

        "text": "A current challenge in neuroscience is identifying how and when brain areas coordinate to generate representations from sensory input, process them and eventually define actions. To find relevant epochs, it is customary in electrophysiology to relate behavioural state information (e.g. waking/sleep states, locomotion, or task execution phases) to LFP power in specific bands, occasionally supplementing this information with multi-unit activity. The relevant LFP spectral bands are generally pre-established according to prior knowledge. In the multivariate case, a growing number of combinations of LFP band power across recording points has to be considered, and it is unclear how to proceed in a structured manner.\n \nHere, we segment multichannel LFP recordings using a fully unsupervised machine-learning approach: A hidden Markov chain with a multivariate autoregressive observation model. This HMM-MAR approach provides a full spectral (and cross-spectral) characterisation of the LFP, including Granger causality and phase information. It therefore enables multivariate automatic, unsupervised brain state discovery and characterisation of LFP recordings, and provides a segmentation mechanism to test hypotheses about circuit function. We show first promising results on multichannel data from the behaving mouse brain.\n",

Towards this goal, we constructed a computational network model of the PFC based on simple single neuron elements [1], yet equipped with highly realistic anatomy and close fitting of cellular and synaptic parameter distributions derived from an extensive data base of prefrontal in vitro and in vivo recordings. The resulting model was reasonably fast to simulate and fit to data, amenable to mean-field approaches, yet exhibiting a high degree of physiological validity, even in a predictive sense. \n\nEven without any tuning, the network model manages to reproduce a number of statistics extracted from in vivo data from awake behaving rats [2]. We tested to which extend this result is affected by the parameters of the model. The network showed robustness against small changes in all tested parameters, but the comparison with the in vivo data also allowed to constrain their range of admissible values. Most notably, it turned out to be important to use the full variability observed in the neuron parameters from the in vitro recordings. Using more homogeneous parameter distributions, as often assumed in network models, impaired the transmission of transient inputs to the network, which may contain information from other brain areas. These results highlight the importance of the diversity of neurons for the generation of realistic network dynamics.\n\nIn summary, we have generated a PFC network model which is biologically highly valid, yet still reasonably fast to simulate and fit, and can now be exploited to probe the impact of pharmacological or genetic conditions on network dynamics, and to model performance in PFC-dependent tasks.",

One plausible derivative of this assumption is that neurons in a given brain area should exhibit different spiking statistics during tasks in which this area is assumed to be involved compared to tasks where it is not. Here we analyzed this idea in simultaneously recorded rodent medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons during simple behaviors that are traditionally not considered PFC dependent versus the quintessential rat PFC dependent task, delayed alternation. We examined both various statistics and properties of the single-unit interspike-interval distributions (like measures of irregularity or auto-correlations) as well as measures of their joint activity (cross-correlations), using spike trains either as they were, or applying strict statistical criteria for separating stationary from non-stationary periods[1]. While under non-stationary conditions several statistics appeared to show a systematic dependency on task complexity, under stationary conditions the single unit statistics did not reveal any differences between delayed alternation and the other tasks considered to be PFC-independent. On the contrary, correlational patterns among units did significantly change with task context. After eliminating the delay period from the delayed alternation task, however, these differences disappear, suggesting that the correlational structure is changing primarily during these periods.",

        "text": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are mostly realized using the P300, motor imagery or steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) measured with the electroencephalogram (EEG) to control external devices. The EEG is measured non-invasively with electrodes mounted on the human scalp using conductive electrode gel for optimal impedance and data quality. But the usage of gel has also some disadvantages: long montage time, abrasion of the skin, need to clean the skin after the recording,… The gel based EEG acquisition limits also the frequent usage of BCI systems on a daily basis. Furthermore the usage of EEG electrode cables has disadvantages: pulling of cables on electrodes produces movements and artifacts, heavier load on head leads to tiredness and more electrode movements if the head is moved, longer experimental preparation time because the cables must be plugged in.\nTherefore a wireless dry active electrode system and wireless gel based active electrode system were developed and compared to a wired gel and dry active electrodes based system. A total of 10 subjects performed BCI experiments. For the P300 BCI system the P300 response and the accuracy, for the SSVEP based BCI system the power spectrum and accuracy and for the motor imagery based BCI reactive frequency components, event-related desynchronization and accuracy were compared. \nThe study showed that the new wireless dry and gel electrodes are able to pick up the corresponding frequency ranges of the EEG data for all three BCI approaches and to achieve better accuracies. The major advantages of the wireless systems (both gel and dry) are the fast montage, less movement artifacts, easier to use and higher comfort of the cap. The major additional advantages of the wireless dry system are that no abrasion and no need of cleaning the skin is required. Nevertheless dry electrodes are more sensitive to noise and therefore a careful montage is necessary which is much easier with the wireless system.\n",

        "text": "Contour integration is an integral part of visual information processing requiring the combination of aligned edge configurations into coherent percepts. Human observers are efficient in detecting contours, reaching peak performances for stimulus presentation times of  ~100ms. Studies depicting these findings used flashed static stimuli, however, in nature we rarely encounter this situation. Rather, we observe visual scenes over time and develop a coherent picture taking into account dynamic changes. We investigated contour detection in dynamic stimuli comprising Gabor elements rotating at unique speeds and directions. Contours formed at a predefined time when a number of rotating Gabors reached a configuration of perfect alignment. Since contour integration is believed to be a pop-out process, we expected similar performances for brief and extended presentations. However, performance dropped from 83% to 65% for extended presentations, indicating that contour detection in prolonged dynamic scenes is more demanding. We quantified to what extent a location cue, a shape cue, and a combination of both, facilitates detection. For brief presentations single cues, and their combination, improved performance by 13%. For long presentations, single cues did not aid performance, but their combination led to an 11% improvement. These result patterns may be caused by physiological or cognitive mechanisms: Neural adaptation reducing activity in prolonged presentations may explain the lower performance in non-cue and single-cue conditions. Cognitively, the visual system might undergo a transition from a predominantly stimulus-driven analysis of a scene to a phase where attention is captured by particular features in a stimulus, thus making it difficult to focus on, and to detect, a newly emerging contour. Currently we are testing these hypotheses by comparing the experimental results to simulations of a contour integration model including attentional modulation.",

        "text": "Once its development is completed the wiring of the peripheral nervous system cannot be modified anymore (Goldberg, 2003).  It is therefore of utmost importance that neurons form the correct connections during axon growth and yet variability can be observed experimentally during this developmental process. In order to find their targets axons react to specific combinations of guidance cues in their environment via cell receptors located on their growth cone, a highly dynamic structure at the tip of the axon.  Numerous of these cues have been characterised individually but their interactions and the mechanisms behind growth cone movement and its variability remain unclear (Mueller, 1999). We have created a stochastic model of growth cone navigation that simulates the cellular processes guiding growth cone turning and progress in response to guidance cues and that also captures its variability. We model each filopodioum as a membrane protrusion of the cytoskeleton with receptors that can measure the relative signal strength of his environment. Based on this input the filopodium grows or shrinks modelled by a stochastic linear kinetic reaction. We model stoichiometry of each receptor and assume it only influences the growth of the closest filopodium. Our growth cone models the stochastic nature of the path-finding mechanism and can therefore be used to analyse variability in axon growth. The parameters are fitted with biological data obtained from cortical and spinal commissural neurons in mice and rats that were cultivated on controlled nano-dot gradients of the signalling cue netrin-1. This experimental setup allows for a quantitative analysis of the neuron’s environment as compared to the usual gradients with diffusive cues.",

        "text": "Most of our classical understanding of axons comes from large, easy to study axons such as the squid giant axon. However, basic physical principles dictate that as axons become thinner, the eff\u000bect of each process happening over their membrane becomes larger. Recently, advances in both theoretical [1, 2] and experimental [3] methods have permitted us to gain valuable insight into the world of small axons. \n\nActive propagation of spikes requires an enormous amount of energy [4, 5, 6], which comes from the potential energy stored in ionic concentration gradients across cell membrane. This pool of energy is fuelled by ionic pumps and depleted by action potentials. In the many thin axon of the nervous system e.g. C-fi\fbres [7, 0.1 μm to 0.3 μm diameter], the amount of charge displaced could result in a noticeable change in concentrations and hence aff\u000bect cell activity [8, 9].\n\nWe developed a Hodgkin-Huxley model where ionic concentrations are no longer constant by using Nernst Equations. Na+ and K+ currents due to ion channels and ionic pumps are used to update ionic concentrations inside and outside the cell. We show that, counter-intuitively, the rate of \ffiring at which an axon can \fre indefi\fnitely is independent of diameter. Sustainable rates of \ffiring (for a given duration), however, do depend on axonal diameter. Using fi\frst principles, we relate pump density, sustainable fi\fring rate, fi\fring duration, and diameter of axons. ATP supply also constraints the anatomy of axons, as the diff\u000busion of ATP is dependent on the diameter. Using data from the resting state energy consumption several axon types, we derive an upper limit on the spacing of source of ATP.\n\nMetabolic constraints limit miniaturization of nervous systems by imposing a lower limit on axonal diameter based on their function. Furthermore, the fi\fnite di\u000bffusion rate of ATP imposes constraints on the placement of sources of ATP, and suggests that glia cells may supply neurons with ATP.",

        "text": "Both common and independent synaptic inputs are delivered to α-motorneurons (MN) which discharge synchronously during isometric contractions [1]. In particular, the common synaptic input to the MN determines correlated output spike trains and, thus, significant peaks in the coherence spectrum at specific frequency bands [2]. This correlation has been demonstrated to be useful for the coordination of MN and for the optimization of motor performance especially for low contraction forces [3]. We hypothesize that the strength of correlation between MN spike trains should increase with force because of the greater number of synaptic projections involved at higher forces [4]. The aim of this study was to verify this hypothesis by estimating the strength of common synaptic input to MN via coherence analysis of motor unit spike trains. Ten healthy subjects performed isometric non-fatiguing contractions of the tibialis anterior muscle at two force levels: 20% (LL) and 75% (HL) of the maximal force. Surface EMG signals were recorded with a 64 electrode grid and decomposed into MU spike trains [5]. A total of 220 MU (LL: 24±6.3, HL: 19±5.7) were identified. The degree of correlation between spike trains was calculated by coherence analysis of the composite spike trains (CST) and the values obtained were converted to standard z scores. The coherence values increased with force in the δ-band (1-5 Hz) (P=0.04) and α-band (5-10 Hz) (P=0.01) but not in the β-band (10-30 Hz) (P=0.39).The coefficient of variation of force increased significantly and the EMG amplitude level increased significantly with the force level (P=0.001 and P==0.0004 respectively). These results indicate that the relative proportion of shared synaptic inputs with respect to the independent inputs to MNs is increasing as a function of the total synaptic current received by the MN pool. We believe that this phenomenon is due to the increased number of active shared projections among MNs at higher force levels.",

The subjects performed brisk ankle dorsiflexions in a cue-based paradigm in 4 conditions combining two speeds (slow and fast, S and F) and two force levels (low and moderate, 20% and 60% of maximum force). The EEG data were segmented into two classes: 1) signal intervals that contain MRCPs during motor imagination; and 2) noise signal intervals. We extract discriminative and locality preserving features of these two classes via a discriminative manifold learning method, called Locality Sensitive Discriminative Analysis (LSDA) [2]. A nearest-neighbor classifier was then applied to these features. The detection performance was evaluated on the experimental data and compared with the previously proposed Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) method [3].\nRESULTS: Compared to LPP, LSDA achieved similar true positive rates (TPR) (F20:0.79±0.15 (LSDA) vs. 0.80±0.16 (LPP); F60:0.84±0.12 vs. 0.85±0.13; S20: 0.78±0.17 vs. 0.78±0.18; S60: 0.76±0.15 vs. 0.76±0.16). However, LSDA significantly reduced the false positive rate (FPR) (F20: 0.27±0.14 (LSDA) vs. 0.37±0.18 (LPP), p=0.007*; F60: 0.26±0.10 vs. 0.33±0.14, p=0.025*; S20: 0.36±0.18 vs. 0.41±0.18, p=0.013*; S60: 0.25±0.22 vs. 0.27±0.24, p=0.117). Fig. 1 provides the results for each subject averaged over the 4 conditions.\nCONCLUSION: The results showed that the proposed application of LSDA for feature extraction outperformed LPP in MRCP detection because of a reduction in FPR. The method can be a promising candidate for developing closed-loop BCI neurorehabilitation systems based on MRCP detection.\n",

        "text": "Alpha motor neurons (MNs) receive common synaptic inputs (CI) from spinal and supraspinal structures [1]. This generates significant level of correlation between motor unit (MU) spike trains (STs). The correct estimation of the CIs may provide information about the connectivity in the spinal cord [2]. Several indexes of correlation have been proposed, but they rely on correlation extracted from pairs of MN output STs, which is not linearly associated to the one in input [3,4].\nIn this study we propose a new index of correlation based on the estimation of the ratio between the strengths of the common and independent (IN) synaptic inputs to a population of MNs. Under the assumption of a weak CI, we estimated this ratio using the coherence values calculated from composite MN STs (CSTs) [4]. The performance of the method was tested using numerical simulations and experimental data.\nThe model had 300 MNs receiving CI and IN Gaussian synaptic inputs. Mean and variance of the current injected in each MN were selected to generate variable discharge rates and CoV for ISI (~15 %) [6] in a physiological range. In the experimental part, MN spike trains were extracted from iEMGs [7] recorded from the ADM muscle of 5 healthy subjects during an isometric contraction at 10 % MVC. Mean coherence values (1-5 Hz) were fitted using least squares method.\nResults showed a linear association between the simulated and estimated proportions of CI ($Y=1.1*X–0.1$,P<0.0001). Conversely, the CIS [5] values were non-linearly related to the simulated proportion of CI. The sensitivity of the proposed index to changes in discharge rate was minimal, whereas the CIS showed a strong dependence on this factor. The experiments also showed a lower variability for the estimates provided by the new index compared with the CIS (~15 % vs 45 %).\nIn conclusion, our new index of correlation between populations of MN STs provides a more reliable estimate of the strength of CI than previously proposed methods.",

        "text": "The recognition of body motion requires the temporal integration of information, which might be accomplished by recurrent networks that are composed from neurons with selectivity for body shapes in particular views [Giese2003]. The fact that body motion perception can be multi-stable [Vanrie2004] and shows adaptation [Jordan2006] suggests that such networks have non-trivial interesting dynamical properties. In order to study these properties mathematically, and as basis for the development of a unifying model for dynamic phenomena in action processing, we propose a neurodynamical model for action recognition. \n\nMethods: The model is based on a two-dimensional neural field [Amari1977] that encodes body postures and their corresponding views. A lateral interaction kernel that is asymmetric in the posture dimension results in a competition between different stimulus views, and makes the field selective for the temporal order of stimulus frames in action movies. The model includes a Gaussian noise process and a linear adaptation dynamics for each point of the field. The adaptation dynamics was fitted quantitatively to electrophysiological data from area IT [deBaene2010].  \n\nResults: The model reproduces multistable perception for action stimuli that are consistent with multiple stimulus views [Vanrie2006]. It also accounts for the fact that repetition suppression effects in action-selective neurons are rather weak [Caggiano2013; Kilner2013]. The neural field predicts an interesting bifurcation dependent on the deviation of the rotation of a walker stimulus relative to the side view: for rotations angles below certain small degree the mutistablity of such stimuli should disappear, which is presently tested in psychophysical experiments.   \n\nConclusions: The proposed model captures a number of dynamic phenomena in action perception which cannot be accounted for by the existing models. In addition, it provides an elegant mathematical framework for their analysis.",

        "text": "One of the most important subjects in neural science is to understand neural mechanism underlying in cognitive function. As neural activities of a large number of neurons can be recorded simultaneously during cognitive tasks, it is observed that not only stationary activated neural activity pattern, but also collective motion of neural activities that changes dynamically emerges during the tasks. These observations suggest that dynamic neural activity pattern, which is represented as trajectory in neural state space, underlies the decision-making process, motor control and other cognitive processes. It is believed that such neural trajectory is shaped through learning process during task training, however, how the trajectory is formed is not uncovered well. \nIn this study, we analyze the formation of neural trajectory during training in a decision-making task, motivated by a characteristic and sequentially activated neural pattern recently observed in an auditory-motor decision making task, in which an rat has to push a different lever according to different frequency tone after some delay time.\nFor understanding such behavior, here, we adopt reservoir network, which corresponds to neural circuit in the cortex. Especially to implement learning process with delay time, we also recruit eligibility trace and reward-modulated Hebbian rule for biological plausibility, while ordinary reservoir computing modifies the synaptic efficacy in on-line way. \nUnder this setting, we analyze the neural behavior that is formed through the learning process and demonstrate that log-normal distribution of synaptic efficacy and multiple time-scale in synaptic change play an important role in stable learning. Further, distinct sequential neural activity patterns depending on the external inputs emerge during the learning process, which are similar to the neural behavior observed in the experimental study.\n",

Most neuron types show spike-frequency adaptation, and finite group size gives rise to fluctuations of the averaged population activity. We have recently developed a theory for the population dynamics of such systems [1, 2]. Here we apply this theory to study how input signals are passed through a chain of populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.\n\nThe mutual information rate between input signal and network response is related to the spectral coherence of the two. We derive the coherences of population activities and inputs in a multi-population network of adapting neurons, where the inputs are injected to an arbitrary subset of neural populations. \n\nContrary to the case of a single population we find that network interactions and adaptation do shape the spectral coherence as the inputs are propagated through the network. Our results show how, at the population level, both neuronal adaptation and the gross anatomical organization of cortical networks into layers and modules contribute to information processing.",

        "text": "Recurrent neuronal networks with bistable dynamics have been proposed as a plausible implementation for short-term memory and decision-making [1,2]. External stimuli can put the recurrently connected population into either a persistent high-activity or into a low-activity state. Here we analyze the response of bistable networks to time-dependent inputs.\n\nMost previous modeling studies used simple step inputs. However, spike-timing has been shown to be relevant in the prefrontal cortex during memory-demanding tasks [3]. Although a few simulation studies show that temporal input modulation influences the dynamics of bistable networks [4], a more thorough understanding of their response properties -- and of how the network's response relates to the single-neuron characteristics -- could be reached through mathematical analysis.\n\nWe studied the response of bistable networks of adapting neurons to temporally modulated stimuli with a mean-field approach and found that these networks can behave like damped oscillators. Therefore, such networks are sensitive to periodic inputs in a specific frequency range, depending on the adaptation properties of single neurons and on the firing history of the network. Hence the temporal structure of the input is a functionally relevant feature determining how efficient and selective the stimulation is.\nThe employed mean-field equations describe recurrent networks of Generalized Linear Model neurons, which can be fitted to data and can predict the response of cortical neurons to time-varying input [5]. Therefore, our results rely on plausible neuronal dynamics under certain assumptions, and can lead to testable predictions of the adequate input frequency provided prefrontal cortex parameters are used. Our work argues for the relevance of temporal codes for  cognitive function, which had been challenged given the chaotic dynamics of recurrent spiking neural networks, and explains how time-dependent inputs can enrich network function.",

Integrating these information sources depends critically on whether visual consequences are associated with one's own action (sense of agency) or with changes in the external world unrelated to the action [2] and the accuracy of integrated signals [3]. Attribution of percepts to consequences of own actions depends thus on the consistency between internally predicted and actual visual signals. \nHowever, is the attribution of agency rather a binary decision (‘I did, or did not cause the visual consequences of the action’ [4]), or is this process based on a more gradual attribution of the degree of agency? Both alternatives result in different behaviors of causal inference models, which we try to distinguish by model comparison.\n\nMETHODS. We used a virtual-reality setup to manipulate the consistency between pointing movements and their visual consequences. We investigated the influence of this manipulation on self-action perception. \nWe compared two Bayesian causal inference models to the experimental data, one with a binary latent agency variable [2], and one with a continuous latent agency variable [4]. \nHere, subject-specific regions for stimulus conditions that maximally differentiate between the two models were identified online using Active Sampling methods [6] to evaluate relative model evidences with a small number of samples. \n\nRESULTS/CONCLUSION. Both models correctly predict the data, and specifically empirical agency ratings showing high attribution of agency for small deviations between sensory and predicted feedback. Some participants show signatures of a binary internal representation of agency. In addition, relationships with other inference models [5] are discussed.",

        "text": "There are numerous algorithms for detection and classification of spikes in extracellular recordings [1]. However, it is still a demanding task to detect spikes in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We design a spike detection algorithm based on fractal properties of extracellular signals and name it fractal detector. We show that it is an efficient detector in low SNR regimes.\nIn fractal detector, the extracted segments of the signal are normalized and then, fractal dimension of each segment is evaluated. Fractal dimension is an extension of Euclidean dimension which measures the irregularity of the signal and has found many applications in signal processing [2,3]. Here, we use it to distinguish between spike and noise segments in extracellular signals.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of a spike detection algorithm, prior knowledge of spike timings is required. Therefore, instead of using experimental data, we simulate extracellular signals using proper spike and noise models. The performance of fractal detector is compared with three common detectors: threshold detector [4], wavelet-PCA detector [5], and average matched filter detector [6]. \n\nIn the following, we summarize the results of this study:\n\n1-\tIt is shown that extracellular signals are fractal signals and can be used for fractal analysis. \n2-\tWe evaluate the histogram of fractal dimension for spike and noise segments and prove that the average of fractal dimension for spike segments is significantly smaller than that of noise segments. Therefore, fractal dimension is an efficient feature for spike detection.\n3-\tIn low SNR regimes, it is demonstrated that fractal detector results in the highest detection probability among the 4 detectors (see the attached figure). \n4-\tWe show that the performance of fractal detector is independent of inter-spike noise power, while the performance of other detectors degrades rapidly by increasing the power of inter-spike noise.",

        "text": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the predominant model for predicting a subject’s decision based on the expected reward value (EV) of each cue, which is adjusted during learning in proportion to a reward prediction error (PE). Common experimental setup utilizes value-neutral cues to study EVs in isolation. However, most environmental cues representing decision options are not neutral but exhibit values intrinsically (e.g. attractive faces), which may interfere with the acquisition of new EVs. This project investigates how such inherent cue value affect the learning of new EV. One possibility is that congruent cue-outcome association with similar inherent value and EV yields faster learning rate (LR) than incongruent pairing.\nWe tested the hypothesis in a 2x2 factorial design, using facial attractiveness (high/low) as a proxy for inherent value and reward probability (0.7/0.3) as a target for learned EV. Subjects were shown  attractive and unattractive face pictures of the opposite gender. Each picture was paired with monetary reward or penalty either congruently or incongruently. Subjects were instructed to select the pictures with the goal of maximizing the overall monetary reward. RL models were fitted to behavioral data using hierarchical Bayesian analysis to derive cue-specific LRs. Concurrent fMRI data were correlated with these LRs, EVs, and PEs.\nBehavioral results indicated both faster response time and faster LR for the congruent cue-outcome pairing. Model-based fMRI analyses revealed that several signals derived from the RL model (LRs, PEs, outcomes) populate the ventral striatum (vStr) in distinct locations. An additional connectivity analysis revealed a functional link between the vStr (encoding LR and PE) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (encoding EV). These findings suggest that value congruency leads to a distinct advantage in learning new reward associations and uncover the functional neural architecture supporting this learning process.",

        "text": "It is well known that the human brain carries two separable, but interacting learning systems: A Pavlovian system learning stimulus-outcome associations, and an instrumental system learning response-outcome associations. The interaction of these systems is demonstrated during Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT), in which instrumental behavior is increased or reduced depending on the presence of a stimulus learned through Pavlovian association. It is assumed that the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine modulate the processing and behavioral influence of stimuli with appetitive or aversive valence. However, it is largely unknown how they affect the interaction of Pavlovian and instrumental learning systems. \nTo investigate the effects of serotonin and dopamine on appetitive and aversive motivation, we developed a novel general PIT task which separately assesses the motivating and demotivating role of previously learned Pavlovian associations on independent instrumental behavior in humans. We reduced central serotonin and dopamine levels by using dietary depletion of tryptophan (n=34) and tyrosine/phenylalanine (n=35), respectively, and compared this to a control group (n=34).\nWe found both appetitive and aversive general PIT, i.e. subjects responded more vigorously in a positively associated context and less vigorously in a negatively associated context. Aversive PIT was stronger in the serotonin group, and appetitive PIT was reduced in the dopamine group.\nThese results demonstrate that serotonin and dopamine are differently involved in motivated behavior: While serotonin serves to reduce the motivational influence of aversive stimuli, dopamine seems to enhance the influence of appetitive stimuli. Together, the results shed light on the involvement of serotonin and dopamine in guiding motivated behavior.",

        "text": "In the brain, interaction among neurons lead to complex patterns and collective behaviors such as phase transitions, brain rhythms, self-organization, and neuronal avalanches. However, despite a significant progress, understanding of collective phenomena and bifurcation mechanisms of phase transitions in the brain still remain elusive. Using an exactly solvable cortical model of neuronal networks with stochastic excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we study collective phenomena and precursors of phase transitions observed in vitro or in vivo brain. We find that, with increasing the intensity of shot noise (a flow of random spikes bombarding neurons), the neuronal network undergoes nonequilibrium first- and second-order phase transitions. Spontaneous neuronal activity preceding the transition is a characteristic property that can be used to identify the type of the transition and the bifurcation mechanism in real neuronal network. We show that bursts, sharp spikes, spindles, and avalanches of neuronal activity are precursors of the transitions. Our most interesting result is the observation of the paroxysmal-like spikes, which are strongly nonlinear events in neuronal activity generated by fluctuations, similar to epileptiform EEG activity. We demonstrate that the power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous neuronal activity gives a rich information about the kind of bifurcation and the closeness of the network to the critical point. Recent studies of the stochastic resonance, bandpass filter, and berger effect are discussed for practical applications of PSD. Our analysis also shows that above a saddle-node bifurcation, sustained network oscillations appear with a large amplitude but a small frequency in contrast to the network oscillations near a supercritical Hopf bifurcation that have a small amplitude but a large frequency.",

        "text": "Cortical neurons in vivo fire irregularly. Previous studies about the origin of such irregular neural dynamics have given rise to two major models: a balanced excitation and inhibition model, and a model of highly synchronized synaptic inputs. To elucidate the network mechanisms underlying synchronized synaptic inputs and account for irregular neural dynamics, we investigate a spatially-extended, conductance-based spiking neural network model. We show that propagating wave patterns with complex dynamics emerge from the network model. These waves sweep past neurons, to which they provide highly synchronized synaptic inputs. These waves only occur when there is a balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, reconciling the two major models of irregular neural dynamics. The resultant distributions of membrane potential are shown to be non-Gaussian, which is consistent with recent experimental data obtained by using whole-cell recordings. We further demonstrate that the collective dynamics of propagating wave patterns provides a mechanistic explanation for \"doubly stochastic\" slow firing rate fluctuations in addition to fast spike timing variability. Our work therefore relates the propagating waves that have been widely observed in the brain to irregular neural dynamics. These results demonstrate that neural firing activity, while appearing highly disordered at the single-neuron level, can form dynamical coherent structures such as propagating waves at the population level.\n",

        "text": "Recent studies have reported layer specificity of dynamical properties of ongoing neuronal activities in various cortical areas [1-3]. A common observation is that activities in the infra-granular layers exhibit pronounced slow oscillations (< 20 Hz). Among visual cortices, the layer specificity has been extensively studied for the primary visual cortex but remains largely unknown for other areas. To elucidate the laminar organization of ongoing neural activities and its functional relevance in visual object recognition, we examined spatio-temporal patterns of local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the inferior temporal cortex of analgesized macaques using linear electrode arrays (32 probes spanning 1.55 or 3.1 mm across cortical layers). During the recordings the animals were presented with 128 visual objects (shapes, gratings, faces, fruits, etc.) on a gray background. Stimulus duration was 0.5 s with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. We found that during the ISIs the LFPs showed strong oscillatory fluctuations in the alpha-beta frequency band (10 – 20 Hz). These oscillations had the strongest power in the lowermost probes, supposedly located in infra-granular layers. These LFP oscillations were considerably suppressed during the stimulus presentation period. In the initial ~0.3 s of stimulus presentation the LFPs showed a stimulus-evoked excitatory modulation that first occurred in deep layers and then propagated to the superficial layers (see Figure). The spatio-temporal patterns of the LFP modulations were specific to the presented stimuli. The observed suppression of ongoing oscillations during stimulation period is consistent with the reported quenching of inter-trial variability by stimulus onset [4], which was argued as a mechanism to enhance reliability of stimulus processing. We will discuss the role of such a mechanism in IT cortex and its implications to the object selective activities that propagate across cortical layers.",

        "text": "Background\nThe GPU enhanced Neuronal Networks (GeNN) framework [1,2] was introduced in 2011 to facilitate the efficient use of graphical processing units (GPUs) as accelerators for neuronal network simulations. GeNN is based on code generation for the NVIDIA CUDA application programming interface. Code generation provides decisive advantages: (i) code can be optimized both for every individual model and for the specific GPU hardware detected at compile time, and (ii) code generation allows to support a practically limitless number of pre-defined models, as well as user-defined models, while the generated simulation code remains as small and efficient as possible.\nWhile GeNN is an important step towards facilitating the use of GPU acceleration for computational neuroscience applications it has been designed with expert users in mind. In this work we are aiming to make GeNN also available to non-expert users by providing two new interfaces from SpineCreator [3]/SpineML [4] and the Brian 2 simulator [5,6] to GeNN.\n\nResults\nWe have created prototype interfaces from SpineCreator using the SpineML markup language and from Brian 2 by modifying the code generation facilities within Brian 2 to generate valid GeNN input files. In both cases, a middleware was created that takes the model descriptions that were either available in SpineML (as generated by SpineCreator) or the internal representation in Brian 2 and translate them into code parts necessary to run a GeNN simulation. The SpineML interface is in alpha testing while the Brian 2 interface is at the stage of proof of concept.\nWe believe that when the new SpineCreator and Brian 2 interfaces will have been fully developed, tested and released we can make a decisive difference in the uptake of GPU acceleration for neuronal network simulations. The completed prototypes show sufficient flexibility and ease of use to be appealing to a wide range of future users.",

        "text": "It has been proposed that one fundamental task accomplished by the brain is to encode sensory stimuli efficiently. This view is supported by the observation that neural activity in sensory areas maximize information transmission. However, most of those observations have been obtained in subjects that are anesthetized, passive, or engaged in tasks that do not require cognitive functions such as memory and decision-making. It remains unclear whether the principle of efficient coding applies to higher brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, while subjects are involved in cognitive tasks.\n\nWe study the response of 681 (non-sensory) cortical neurons to reward events during strategic decision-making in primates. We showed previously that the dynamics of those responses is highly heterogeneous and spans two orders of magnitude, from 100ms to 10s [1]. We hypothesize that this variety of responses is a consequence of efficient coding. We build a model of a neural circuit, and we compute the synaptic matrix that maximizes information transmission. We show that the model matches the experimental observations in terms of both the marginal and the joint statistics of timescales and amplitudes of the neural responses.\n\nOur results suggest that the efficient coding hypothesis predicts not only the spatial properties of neural response (e.g. receptive fields), but also its temporal properties, on a broad range of timescales, and it can be applied to non-sensory areas. While the efficient coding hypothesis predicts maximum information, it does not address the question of how this information is used. Future work will focus on the question of how efficient coding of reward is used for decision-making, with the overarching goal of bridging the gap between sensory coding and behavior. \n",

A few neural circuit models that implement maximum information have been proposed, but most of them are biologically implausible or they are unable to reproduce basic physiological observations. \n\nAmong the many facets of maximum information, we focus on decorrelation, the reduction of correlations across neuron pairs. Several mechanisms have been proposed for decorrelation in neural circuits. One mechanism is inhibitory feedback, which is well supported by experimental testing [1,2]. However, it does not explain the development of neural coding for sensory stimuli. Another mechanism is anti-Hebbian plasticity, which explains neural circuit development but is not experimentally supported [3] and it cannot maintain any memory of the input stimuli [4].\n\nWe introduce a biologically realistic synaptic plasticity rule based on STDP. We show that this rule can enable the system to sense both the spatial and temporal properties of inputs and decorrelate the sensory inputs. Furthermore, it maintains the memory of those inputs on arbitrary timescales. The model is able to account for a wide range of physiological observations, including balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents, the long-tailed and non-random distribution of synaptic strengths [5,6]. Interestingly, both the distribution of synapses and the balanced state have a strong influence on the decorrelation process. The simultaneous properties of maximum information and multi-scale memory make the model a candidate for efficient neural computation.\n\n",

        "text": "The information of the stimulus variable $S$ in a population of $n$ observed neurons $R_0 \\ldots R_n$ can be measured using the mutual information $I(S:R_0 \\ldots R_n)$. In order to gain a deeper understanding about the stimulus encoding in the neural population the question arises how to decompose the mutual information. A decomposition may reveal sets of neurons that share the same information about the stimulus, or sets of neurons that encode information synergistically or a single neurons that may encode information about the stimulus that is not present in any of the other observed neurons.\n\nThere are several properties that seem obviously necessary to hold for a mutual information decomposition. But these properties alone do not provide enough constraints to result in a unique solution and it is not clear how to resolve for this ambiguity. Several approaches have been suggested recently ([Williams2010], [Harder2013], [Griffith2014]) but we find that all of them suffer from certain caveats.\n\nHere, we introduce a new approach how to decompose the mutual information of two different neural populations with a stimulus into independent, unique, and synergistic components. We demonstrate its strength compared to previously proposed decompositions and present several examples that corroborate its usefulness. In particular, we believe the decomposition can serve as a useful relaxation to the problem of causality estimation.",

        "text": "\tHow do sensory systems extract meaningful information from complex signals in the environment? To address this question, one can start from the observation that sensory signals tend to vary at a fast timescale compared to the source of these signals in the environment. For example, the physical location of a sound source varies more slowly than the acoustical pressure. This has led several authors to propose statistical learning algorithms that extract slowly varying features of sensory signals [Wiskott et al, 2002], which is also related to psychological theories according to which the basis of perception is the “invariant structure” of the sensory (or sensorimotor) signals [Gibson, 1986]. Sprekeler et al. [Sprekeler et al, 2007] have shown how Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) can be implemented with rate-based neuron models, in a way that is consistent with known experimental facts on synaptic plasticity. However, no practical implementation of this concept has been made with biophysical neuron models.\n\n\tIn this work, we show both mathematically and with simulations of spiking neurons how an optimization criterion derived from slowness can be implemented by neurons, and we apply this in the context of auditory signals. Using the post-synaptic voltage as a target for the slowness criterion, and similarly to what has already been done in [Rozell et al, 2008] for sparseness, we used the internal dynamics of integrate-and-fire neurons to perform an on-line optimization of our objective function. We show that spiking neurons can encode, in their subthreshold dynamics, the slowly time-varying components of their inputs, with synaptic learning rules compatible with known experimental facts on plasticity.",

        "text": "Interaural Level Difference (ILD) provides an important cue for the location of a sound source in the azimuthal plane. ILD coding in the brainstem is usually modeled using a rate code in the lateral superior olive (LSO) [1–3]. In these models, the number of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) over a given period of time is effectively subtracted from the number of excitatory PSPs over the same period.  The spike rate of the LSO cell is then proportional to the result. \n\nRecent experimental evidence from the medial superior olive shows that inhibition may play a role in modulating the delays of excitatory post-synaptic potentials [4]. LSO cells in mammals receive inhibitory input from the same source. We hypothesize that inhibition may play a related but different role in LSO cells, modulating the amplitude of excitatory post synaptic potentials, delaying the production of action potentials. This would provide a spike timing cue for ILD at the level of the inferior colliculus. It is important to note that these spike-timing cues would be initiated in the ILD encoding cells, and timing cues for sound level may be absent from the inputs to the LSO.\n\nIn this study, the auditory periphery was modeled as a gammatone filterbank which provided inputs directly to a leaky integrate-and-fire model representing the cells of the cochlear nucleus. These cells are known to lock to the envelope of the sound stimulus, and this behavior was recreated by low-pass filtering of the gammatone filterbank inputs to the cells, and use of a dynamic spike threshold mechanism [5]. The LSO cells and IC cells were both modeled as simple leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. The model was able to recreate the modulation of spike timing by inhibition in the LSO and the variation of this effect with sound source intensity. The model also recreated the potential ‘decoding’ of this cue by cells of the IC.\n",

        "text": "In primary visual cortex (V1), fast-spiking parvalbumin positive interneurons (PV+ INs) constitute the largest neuronal population mediating GABAergic inhibition and modulate tuning properties of excitatory cells, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation, contrast and size. Like pyramidal cells, PV+ INs receive excitatory input through glutamate receptors, the disruption of which has been implicated in impairments of visual feature integration and figure-ground segregation. Here we examined the impact of NMDA-glutamate receptor ablation in PV+ INs on visual information processing.\n\nWe generated transgenic mice lacking NMDA receptors in PV+ INs (NR1-PVCre-/- Korotkova et al., 2010). We recorded V1 extracellular activity of head-fixed, transgenic and littermate control mice placed on a Styrofoam ball. We assessed spatial integration by measuring size tuning curves with gratings of different diameters, and we measured selectivity for orientation and contrast with full-field gratings.\n\nWe first compared overall neural activity, and found that both baseline and peak firing rates were largely similar between genotypes. We next tested the role of NMDA receptors in PV+ INs for spatial integration. Compared to control mice, V1 cells in NR1-PVCre-/- mice had smaller receptive field center sizes and stronger surround suppression. This difference in spatial integration persisted even after equating for differences in locomotion parameters.\n\nSince previous studies suggested that PV+ INs might shape spatial integration via contrast gain control mechanisms, we also investigated whether NMDA receptors in PV+ INs contributed to contrast sensitivity. Compared to control mice, V1 cells in NR1-PVCre-/- had higher sensitivity for stimulus contrast, which could, at least partly, mediate sharper tuning for stimulus size.\n\nWe conclude that NMDA transmission in PV+ INs shapes selectivity of neighboring pyramidal cells for stimulus size, possibly via mechanisms of contrast gain control.",

Especially visual attention has been focus of investigation to a lot of research areas. \nHowever, there are still only a few applications that make use of the potential of neurobiological findings, although this could lead to a new generation of technical systems, which can exceed the capabilities of state-of-the-art systems. We aim to close this gap by focusing on the functional body of the neuronal information processing to enable fast and efficient technical applications.\n\nRecently, we presented sampled template collation - a novel method for generating saliency maps. The salient regions are calculated comparing randomly sampled templates over an image using a higher order metric. A templates' saliency score is calculated comparing light and color in the Lab* color space using a L2-norm and the template's entropy. Our method showed similar results as state-of-the-art visual attention systems yet being scalable for real-time applications.\n\nWe enhanced our method for object segmentation by following the neural mechanism of object-based selection in the visual cortex. The activity patterns in early visual areas are strongly biased in favor of the attended object [Cohen et al, 2013]. We are using the same underlying principles of sampled template collation for enabling object-based attention in our system. At the maximum salient point in the image, we sample a seed template to which all later sampled templates are compared to using a similar similarity metric as for the visual attention step. The response is a object-based attentional map which is highly biased towards the original seed template and can be used for further processing as segmentation or object recognition.",

        "text": "With only 302 neurons [1], C. elegans exhibits remarkably rich learning.\nIn particular, its sensory neurons exhibit distinct forms of associative and non-associative learning that depend on the neuron in question, on the stimulus and on the protocols used [2-5]. Such extensive processing inevitably leads to a filtering of information about the environment. We ask how the animalʼs natural environment is encoded in the nervous system and how this encoding generates appropriate responses.\nC. elegans senses attractive NaCl concentrations predominantly with one pair of neurons, ASEL and ASER, that respond to NaCl concentration increases and decreases respectively. We measured these responses using calcium imaging and found distinct forms of adaptation in the left (ASEL) and right (ASER) neurons: ASEL desensitized following pre-exposure to sodium chloride; ASER sensitized with pre-exposure.\nTo explore the behavioral consequences of this sensory adaptation, we created a computational model and simulated animals with and without adaptation in ASEL and ASER in a variety of different virtual environments. We found that ASEL adaptation is best described by an additive form of threshold modulation. We demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of such a mechanism in navigating smooth gradients; complex spaces including steep gradients separating large homogeneous areas; and regions with fluctuating concentration fields.\nIn contrast, we found that a multiplicative function best captures physiological data on ASER adaptation. Consequently, the rate of adaptation encodes the stimulus history including the pre-exposure concentrations and durations. Simulating worms in virtual arenas with salt patches of varying size and concentration, animals spent more time in larger, high concentration patches while ignoring smaller regions of salt.\nThus we predict that cell-autonomous adaptation in the ASER sensory neuron has the potential to underpin a rudimentary form of spatial memory.",

Such sensory fusion allows extracting reliable information from the local environment and building an internal spatial representation [1]. Amongst other quantities the estimation of ego-motion is important to keep the external state (i.e. environmental information) and the organism’s internal state coherent [2]. Due to the multimodal nature of incoming streams of sensory information, ego-motion estimation is a challenging sensor fusion problem. In this work we present a distributed cortically inspired processing scheme for sensor fusion [3]. It processes various sensory inputs, maintains simple relations defining inter-sensory dependencies, and ultimately relaxes into a solution which provides a plausible interpretation of the perceived ego-motion. Without precise modeling and parametrization of the system, our model is able to combine information from multiple sensors into a globally consistent estimate, which is more precise than individual  estimates. Balancing contributions of external sensors with its internal belief, our network is able to detect and compensate for sensor inconsistencies. The proposed model has been implemented for ego-motion estimation on an autonomous mobile robot. We demonstrate that the model provides a precise estimate of both robot position and orientation, comparable with optimal state-of-the-art sensor methods [4].",

        "text": "Motion detection is an essential and basic feat of any natural vision system. The speed and efficiency found in natural systems is hard to match by engineered artifacts. The limiting factors are slow frame-based cameras on the one hand, and computationally costly data-processing on sequential computers on the other hand. We circumvent both by utilizing novel, neuromorphic technologies. \n\nWe construct biologically inspired motion detectors using a silicon retina and a neuromorphic computer. The silicon retina (DVS[1]) is an event-based camera in which each pixel asynchronously reports a locally perceived change in luminosity. A specially developed interface [2] processes these events and passes them as virtual neural spikes into SpiNNaker [3]. A spiking neural network on SpiNNaker receives these spikes and detects motion based on the Barlow-Levick or Reichardt-Hassenstein schemes, which are considered to be the basis for motion detection in both insects [4] and mammals [5]. \nThe perceived motion can be used to visualize an optic flow map on a host PC or to control a mobile robot, on which the DVS is mounted.\n\nThe unique combination of an asynchronous event-based vision sensor (DVS) with microsecond accuracy and a massively parallel neuromorphic computer (SpiNNaker) enables high estimation precision and low latency for possible high-speed closed-loop control of engineered systems. \n\nFuture algorithmic developments will interpret the perceived optic flow vector field in real time to (a) reliably extract ego-motion, to (b) perform object/background segmentation, and to (c) recognize gestures in man-machine interfaces for robot control.\n",

        "text": "For many decades cell assemblies have been suggested as the crucial neuro-computational or representational unit underlying behavioral processes as diverse as memory retrieval, planning, decision making, or object recognition. Multiple hypotheses have been advanced on the exact nature of neural activity organization within assemblies. Assemblies have been defined by the exactly synchronized spiking times within a collection of neurons, by precise temporal relations within sequences of spiking patterns, by temporally ordered patterns of firing rate or bursting activity, or much more generally just by a common increase of the firing rates within a set of neurons. \nThanks to recent advances in electrophysiological techniques for recording multiple single units (MSU) simultaneously, it is now possible to test and investigate this key concept from an experimental point of view. In our work we propose a novel, simple, and comparatively fast method for detecting cell assemblies from MSU recordings at various levels of organization, i.e. accommodating different of the cell assembly definitions that have been advanced. It is based on the occurrence frequencies of firing, or spiking, patterns with different temporal resolutions whose significance is assessed through simple chi-square-based statistics. \nCompared to other detection methods present in literature, which are often designed based on a specific definition of cell assembly structure, our method is able to detect assemblies according to different possible definitions, and within relatively short time. It returns information on both the precise composition of the detected assemblies as well as their temporal structure. Here we present its validation on simulated data as well as its application to experimental data.",

        "text": "Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) respond to odor stimuli with temporal patterns of activity that depend on odor identity, odor concentration and receptor type. We performed measurements of the activity of single ORNs in Drosophila and analyzed these temporal patterns taking in account a precise quantification of the time dependent stimulus. We found that the dynamics of the odor stimulus itself depends on odor identity and concentration and that it strongly modulates the ORN response. We were able to assign a single response function to a single ORN and to predict the response of this ORN to two different odors solely from measurements of the stimulus. We also found that ORN adaptation capabilities maintain response dynamics remarkably similar across a large range of stimulus and background intensities (Martelli, 2013). \nThese results suggest that ORN response properties enable the olfactory system to capture information about stimulus independently from its intensity. In order to investigate this hypothesis we developed a computational model of the Drosophila Antennal Lobe (AL), the first synaptic processing center of olfactory information. Our simulation includes three neuron populations: ORNs, inhibitory Local Neurons (LN) and output Projection Neurons (PNs). The model reproduces known static properties of the AL (the divisive normalization, Olsen 2010) while providing temporal resolution on the activity of the single neurons. We investigate how dynamical properties of the input ORN activity affect the encoding of single odorants and odor mixtures in the population of PNs. \n",

        "text": "Sensory signals are known to be selectively routed throughout the brain. This is particularly evident in the visual system during selective attention. In area V4 of the visual cortex, neurons with several stimuli in their receptive field exhibit behavior as though only the attended stimulus is present. A possible explanation for this effect revolves around gamma rhythm (60-80Hz) phase-locking between lower and higher visual areas. When the attended stimulus activates one V1 site, its gamma oscillations synchronize to the pertinent site in V4, thus facilitating information transfer (\"communication through coherence\", CTC). However, it is still not certain whether this synchronization is in fact causally involved in the information gating mechanisms. To explore the CTC hypothesis, a model has been developed that reproduces these experimental results. It consists of populations of excitatory and inhibitory, conductance-based quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, structured into a two-layered (V1 and V4) network with distance-dependent lateral connectivity and converging feed-forward connections. The model produces gamma rhythms that arise inherently from the network’s structure and exhibits synchronization of V1 gamma-band activity to activity in the V4 layer. In the present study, we explore the model further by introducing outside electrical stimulations to the local populations, exploring their effect on the phase coherence. The simulations go over a comprehensive set of electrical stimulations applied to multiple subsets of neurons within the populations of the model, resulting in a set of phase-response curves that can be used to causally shift the model's “attention” between the presented stimuli. These results will be used in future electrophysiological experimental studies allowing us to critically test whether gamma-band synchronization serves as the gating mechanism for attention driven routing of information.",

        "text": "Recent experimental and theoretical work established the hypothesis that cortical neurons operate close to critical states describing a phase transition from chaotic to ordered dynamics [1-2]. Such states are suggested to optimize neuronal information processing [3-4]. However, although critical dynamics have been demonstrated in recordings of spontaneously active cortical neurons [5], little is known about how these dynamics are affected by task-dependent changes in neuronal activity when the cortex is engaged in stimulus processing. We explore this question in the context of visual information processing modulated by selective attention: It has been shown that local field potentials (LFPs) in macaque area V4 exhibit an increase in gamma-band synchrony and a simultaneous enhancement of object representation with attention [6]. We reproduce these results using a model of integrate-and-fire neurons where attention increases synchrony by enhancing efficacy of recurrent interactions. In dependence on excitatory and inhibitory coupling strengths, we investigate the role of synchrony in enhancing stimulus processing and information transmission using information theoretical measures. We identify regions in which the diversity of activation patterns in response to different stimuli is maximized. Additionally, we compute information entropy and analyze the separability of activation patterns for different stimuli in the space of all possible activation patterns. We find that the maximum network repertoire as well as entropy maxima are associated with the emergence of synchrony near the critical points. Strikingly, only a narrow region in phase space at the transition from sub- to supercritical dynamics supports the experimentally observed discriminability increase. We therefore suggest that cortical networks operate at such near-critical states, allowing minimal attentional modulations of network excitability to substantially augment stimulus representation.",

        "text": "We investigate how neuronal networks process odor representations resulting either stimulus categorization or discrimination. We use Drosophila to examine the spatio-temporal representations of different monomolecular odors and their binary mixtures in the first olfactory neuropil, the antennal lobe. Flies perceive odors with olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that project into the antennal lobe, which consists of anatomically discrete subunits (glomeruli). OSNs expressing the same receptors converge to the same glomeruli where they synapse onto local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs). PNs convey olfactory information to higher brain regions. We express the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP3 in order to monitor calcium activity patterns evoked by different concentrations of odors in both OSNs and PNs. Glomerular activity patterns were found to change substantially with increasing odor concentrations in OSNs. However, PNs showed a higher degree of invariance over a broad concentration range. To further test whether different sensory inputs are processed in a way such that they are discriminated or categorized, we varied both the concentration as well as molecular identity of odors by gradually shifting the concentration ratios of binary odorant mixtures. Changing the concentration ratios of the odorants in the mixtures resulted in abrupt transitions between the odor representations in PNs. The neuronal circuit of the antennal lobe causes a categorization of the odor representations into discrete and distinct output patterns, enabling the flies to generalize and categorize different odors. We will further continue to dissect the neuronal elements of the antennal lobe network which mediate this stimulus processing.",

        "text": "Decades of research have led to a thorough description of the insect mushroom body as a neuronal circuit involved in the control of adaptive behavior, e.g., associative learning. In particular, it has been revealed that mushroom body functions rely on the modulation of the mushroom body intrinsic Kenyon cells by biogenic amines, e.g., octopamine, dopamine or serotonin. Learning-induced plasticity has been proposed to be localized to the contact sites between aminergic neurons and Kenyon cells. Therefore, we asked which modulatory neurons interact with anatomically and functionally distinct mushroom body regions, and where exactly within the mushroom body subdivisions it is that they do so.\n\n We have adapted the recently described splitGFP-technique to label contact sites between mushroom body intrinsic Kenyon cells and extrinsic neurons. Using this approach we find spatially and structurally different contact regions between three neuromodulatory type of neurons and Kenyon cells in different subdivision of mushroom body, as well as spatially distinct zones of connectivy between Kenyon cells and aminergic neurons. \n\nHaving localized the contact regions between aminergic neurons and Kenyon cells, we next aimed at addressing the physiology at those defined cellular regions. We therefore generated several transgenic flies that can be combined with the splitGFP label to trace back individual extrinsic or intrinsic neurons or to record neuronal activity using optical imaging. These fly strains can be used to combine  physiological and fine-scale anatomical studies, e.g. for monitoring odor-induced activity of Kenyon cells and plasticity at defined anatomical contact regions between Kenyon cells and extrinsic neurons.\n",

        "text": "Judgments of magnitude have a subjective component with systematic properties. The magnitude of the errors scale with the magnitude of the stimulus (scalar variability) and the errors tend towards the mean (regression effect). However, it is unclear how similar these systematic errors are within subjects but between magnitudes. Similarities in systematic errors across sensory modalities have been used to argue for a common neural substrate for time estimation. However, systematic errors in both distance and time estimation appear to result from combining the current sensory input with previous knowledge or expectations of the sensory input; which would imply a common but distributed mechanism. \nWe examined distance and time estimation for two different but overlapping stimulus ranges, using the same production-reproduction paradigm with visual optic flow. Subjects completed all sessions of one magnitude before being tested on the other magnitude. The order in which the stimuli were presented within one subject was consistent such that a single trial for time estimation had an equivalent distance to be estimated. This was done because the order of stimulus presentation also has an effect on the systematic errors made. In addition, subjects estimated distance and time for a single range during fMRI. Time and distance estimation were measured in separate fMRI sessions. An additional control task, in which subjects moved freely but did not have to reproduce any magnitude, served as a control for both sessions.\nOur preliminary findings suggest that for both time and distance, within subject behavior is more similar than between subject behavior; consistent with previous results [1]. These results are reflected in the hemodynamic activity during these tasks. Future work will focus on adapting existing theoretical principles to explain current results and applying these principles to explain the hemodynamic response seen in both of these tasks.",

        "text": "Mean-field theory has been very successful to link single neuron properties to the macroscopic population activity for homogeneous networks of spiking neurons (e.g. [1,2]). These studies only account for the mean population activity. This first-order statistics is sufficient to describe infinitely large neural populations, in which fluctuations of the macroscopic activity around its mean vanish. However, realistic neural populations of similar neurons can be rather small (e.g. N~1000) and macroscopic fluctuations cannot be neglected in this case.\n\nA statistical description of such finite-size fluctuations of spiking neural networks (second-order statistics) is a challenging theoretical problem. Existing theories are either based on rather simplified neuron models or rely on certain heuristic assumptions. Here, we systematically derive stochastic population equations for the large class of generalized integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-triggered adaptation. Using a quasi-renewal approximation [3], we find a stochastic differential equation for the survivor function of the quasi-renewal process for any given last spike time. This leads to an additional noise term in the mean-field equations of [2].\n\nUsing our theory, we study spontaneous transitions between up and down states in a bistable network purely induced by intrinsic finite-size noise. Furthermore, in the asynchronous cortical state, we analytically calculate the spectral properties of the fluctuations by linearizing the dynamics about the mean activity. This allows us to investigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation and recurrent connectivity on the spontaneous activity (noise shaping) [4] and its implications for information processing.\n",

        "text": "Although the co-existence of both reward and saliency related signals in human ventral striatum (vStr) has been confirmed [1,2], the precise interaction between these two signals has not been fully resolved. Here, we approach this question computationally using a conditioning task that requires subject to make probabilistic choices for salient visual stimuli in order to obtain conditional reward. 27 participants were instructed to predict the occurrence of a visual stimulus by choosing between left and right button presses in the fMRI scanner. We compared a condition in which the stimulus appeared randomly on either side (Equal), against a condition in which the higher stimulus probability was assigned to the lower reward probability side (Biased), where the salient visual stimulus was misleading for the reward distribution. We found out that subjects tend to trade off the reward against the predictability of where the stimulus is more likely to appear. Behavioral results were analyzed on a single trial basis using reinforcement learning models. The stimulus prediction error (PE) and the reward PE are used in a model-based fMRI analysis and we found both PEs in the vStr suggesting that this region responses for general surprising perceptual events as well as unexpected reward delivery or omission. Furthermore, the activation patterns of either PE is different under the experimental manipulations: The stimulus PE is stronger in the Biased-condition whereas the reward PE is stronger in the Equal-condition (Figure 1). This neural activation pattern was related to the behavior that subjects went for the stimulus in the Biased-condition, but tend to optimize the performance in the Equal-condition. These data raise a possibility that the striatum encodes a value-nonspecific saliency signal in the same fashion as the reward signal for guiding behavior and that neural populations encoding these error signals are recruited dynamically depending on the experimental context.",

        "text": "Salamander is a common model to study visual encoding in the retina, in particular the encoding of motion. We investigate the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to different motion schemes like fast global jitter, jittering local objects and slow global drift. \nWe found three functional types of RGCs. First, object-motion-sensitive (OMS) cells preferably respond to local motion of objects, but not when the whole scene is moving coherently (Ölveczky et al., Nature 2003). Second, we found direction-selective (DS) cells, which are known from mouse and rabbit, but not well studied in salamander. Third, we found a ganglion cell type that combines both functions. These OMS-DS cells respond selectively to a certain direction of motion and prefer small moving objects instead of global drift.\nThe two different kinds of DS cells not only differ in their preferences for global or local stimuli, but also in the organization of preferred motion directions. For standard DS cells the preferred directions occur in three clusters, separated by 120 degrees angular difference. The OMS-DS cells have two or more primary directions of 90 degrees angular difference. This suggests an interesting analogy to the DS cell types observed in the mammalian retina.",

        "text": "How natural scenes are encoded by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is still an unsolved problem. Here, we study how natural images are represented in the RGC responses by recording spikes from isolated axolotl retinas, using a multielectrode array. As stimuli, we applied a set of natural images as well as artificial noise-like stimuli and found that responses to natural images are stronger and more reliable. For each image of the stimulus set, we obtained a linearly filtered image by weighting the image with the receptive field profile. We then obtained a prediction for the spike count response through a linear-nonlinear (LN) model. \nTo go beyond the LN model, we also analyzed the standard deviation of the linearly filtered images as a measure of local spatial contrast. We found that local spatial contrast is higher for the natural images than for artificial images, despite similar global contrast. In addition, local spatial contrast is positively correlated to the spike count response, and incorporating local spatial contrast in the LN model can improve spike count predictions. Finally, we used closed-loop experiments to compare responses to natural images with different degrees of spatial blurring while keeping the mean contrast over the receptive field of a given ganglion cell constant. These experiments showed that the spike count responses decay dramatically when local spatial contrast is decreased. Together, these results suggest that, besides mean light intensity, spatial contrast exerts a strong effect on RGC responses. This implies that spatial nonlinearities are important for predicting responses to natural images and that some of these effects can be captured by looking at the spatial contrast inside the receptive field.",

        "text": "The receptive field is one of the most common ways to characterize the function of a neuron. Yet, receptive fields may contain further, elaborate substructure, as found, for example, in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) [1, 2]. A method for detecting this substructure without detailed measurements of the anatomical and physiological cell properties is currently lacking.\n\nHere, we propose a novel method, called sample-based semi non-negative matrix tri-factorization (ssNM3F), for identifying substructure in receptive fields. This method is derived from semi non-negative matrix factorization [3] and sample-based non-negative matrix tri-factorization (sNM3F) [4]. Like sNM3F, our method decomposes data into non-negative space-by-time components and activation coefficients for those components. Unlike sNM3F, however, activation coefficients can also be negative.\n\nWe present a proof of convergence for ssNM3F. We then demonstrate the technique on data that were recorded extracellularly from salamander RGCs. The data consist of the spike-triggered stimulus ensembles of individual cells, obtained under stimulation with spatio-temporal white noise. We find that ssNM3F can decompose the spike-triggered ensemble into factorized spatial and temporal components and associated activation coefficients. Variance-accounted-for (VAF) increases with increasing number of spatial and temporal components. We also find that the relaxation of the non-negativity constraint for the activation coefficients is a crucial prerequisite for increasing the VAF with increasing number of components. The number of components is selected by minimizing the Akaike information criterion. In our dataset, we find that, for many cells, the optimal number of spatial components is greater than unity.\n\nThese results suggest that ssNM3F can successfully detect substructure in receptive fields of RGCs and that semi-sNM3F can thereby provide a more detailed characterization of the spike-triggered ensemble.",

        "text": "The retina is a complex neural network which extracts visual features from the environment. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form the output layer of this network. More than 15 different RGC types have been identified in the vertebrate retina using a variety of anatomical and physiological properties. Each RGC type is believed to relay specific features of the visual scene. It is not fully known, however, which features are being encoded. Thus, considerable effort is put into classifying RGCs based on their response properties. We identified RGCs in the axolotl retina, employing a spectral clustering algorithm. Spiking activity of RGCs was recorded extracellularly, using a 252-channel multielectrode array with offline spike-sorting. With this setup, typically more than 200 RGCs could be recovered from a single retina. The retina was stimulated with spatiotemporal white noise, and the receptive field dynamics for each RGC were obtained by reverse correlation (spike-triggered average).  We classified the cells by the clustering algorithm, based on the similarity of the cells’ receptive field sizes and their temporal filtering characteristics. We estimated the number of clusters using Akaike and Bayesian information criteria to be between 15 and 20. We observed groups with similar temporal properties (e.g., fast OFF cells), which could be separated based on their receptive field sizes. Moreover, a mosaic pattern of the receptive fields (a tell-tale sign of a single RGC type) was seen in more than a single cluster, in contrast to what had been previously reported for salamanders.",

Weakly electric fish provide a prime example for parallel processing in the sensory domain, since they posses two electrosensory systems: The  tuberous—or active—system is tuned to the fish’s own field and responds to distortions of this field imposed by nearby objects or the fields of conspecifics and their communication signals, called chirps. The ampullary—or passive—system responds to low-frequency modulations of electric fields as caused by prey items or chirps of some species of weakly  electric fish. We studied the neuronal representation of electric communication signals in the tuberous and ampullary system of E. virescens. We first characterized different kinds communication signals in behavioral experiments including a previously undescribed chirp. In subsequent in vivo electrophysiological recordings we studied the responses of both electrosensory systems to chirps. We show that different types of  electroreceptors encode different aspects of communication signals. Through a decoding analysis of single neurons and small populations we demonstrate that this specialization leads to complementary information in the tuberous and ampullary system about the different chirp  types. This suggests that a potential readout mechanism should consider the information provided by both parallel processing streams.\n",

        "text": "It is indicated, both experimentally in the form of population-based processing [1] and from simulations [2], that multilayer spiking networks contribute importantly to neural processing within the brain. In particular, it has been shown that spiking networks containing hidden neurons improves performance when learning to classify input patterns between two output classes, by a spike/no-spike coding scheme [3]. However, neurons may encode information by the precise timing of spikes, that allows the classification of inputs between a large number of possible output classes.\nHere, we introduce a new supervised multilayer learning rule for a spiking network that is biologically plausible and can classify input patterns on a spatio-temporally coded basis. We use a statistical approach to derive our learning rule, combined with the technique of back-propagation, that maximises the likelihood of the network generating a desired output spike pattern. Our method is derived for a network with a single hidden layer, but it can also straightforwardly be extended to networks with multiple hidden layers.\nThrough simulations, we demonstrate that our multilayer rule can learn to map between multiple spatio-temporal spike patterns and output spike trains, thereby establishing the practical utility of our method. Furthermore, we also will show how our learning rule can be extended to learning by reinforcement in a multilayer network, and its relation to the reward-maximising learning rule for a single-layer network [4].",

        "text": "The mid $1860s$ saw the beginning of amazing discoveries as pertains to aspects of the visual system.  Schultze in this period discovered the existence of two distinct photoreceptors; Rods and Cones.  Santiago Ramon y Cajal a little later, $1930s$, discovered the existence of distinct retinal ganglion classes. Great strides in the understanding of how visual information is processed have been made from this time. In the recent past, aspects pertaining to the visual transduction process have become more apparent.  One such aspect is the importance of the convergence of the rod and cone systems to local adaptation and contrast gain control, processes extremely vital to the visual transduction process and therefore to adequate vision. However, because research until recently showed that Rod and Cone systems have operated autonomously of each other, existing retinal models have been on either system and have not incorporated this convergence.  By our research we propose a new retina model, which is biologically plausible, computationally simple and effective, and one that captures the convergence of Rod and Cone systems both in the Outer and Inner Plexiform Layers of the retina.  We also show how this convergence improves the perception of contrast and therefore the quality of vision.",

        "text": "Event-related responses in the high gamma frequency range (>60 Hz) have been observed in many different functional brain systems.  A recent study showed significant activation of intracranial EEG band-power between 60-170 Hz in the inferior temporal gyrus in response to visually presented numerals [1]. Other, fMRI based studies, revealed the involvement of the occipitotemporal region in abacus-based mental calculation tasks [2,3]. In the present work, we want to demonstrate the involvement of the ventral occipitotemporal region in an abacus-based counting/arithmetic task using functional ECoG mapping.\nThe real-time functional mapping system cortiQ (g.tec, Austria) was used to analyze data collected with a 256-channel g.HIamp system (g.tec, Austria). The cortiQ mapping system presented the stimuli and processed incoming data.  In this study a right-handed female patient with epilepsy who had 236 subdural electrodes implanted, participated the mapping procedure. The implanted electrodes covered the left frontal-, left temporal- and left parietal/occipital lobe, the right temporal lobe, as well as the left and right temporal base. The paradigm consisted of a 45s long counting task split into three periods of 15s and a 45s long resting period. At the beginning of the counting task the subject was asked to count from a given number (e.g., 300) either upwards or downwards in fixed steps. The paradigm was repeated three times in independent runs.\nWhile performing the task, significant activation of the high-gamma frequency band was detected over the ventral occipitotemporal region of the right hemisphere. All three mapping sessions consistently showed the same strong activation patterns across Brodmann areas 20 and 37, as well as small activation across Brodmann areas 21, 22, 41 and 42.\n As the subject reported imagination of an abacus, the identified activation pattern in the occipitotemporal region corresponded to an abacus-based counting task.",

        "text": "Processing of speech is one of the key functions of the human auditory system. Recognition of spoken words requires the detection of fine spectro-temporal acoustic features that can be orders of magnitudes shorter than the temporal extent of the encompassing auditory stream. It is unknown through which mechanisms of synaptic plasticity auditory neurons can learn to tune their responses to the relevant features. To solve the associated credit assignment problem, current speech recognition systems require either temporally segmented training data or rely on complicated algorithms for segmentation estimation that lack biologically plausible implementations.\n\nHere we present a novel spiking neuron model of auditory processing that is capable to learn to detect phonemes in streams of natural speech without temporally segmented training data. This model is based on the recently proposed multi-spike tempotron[1] that learns to detect target features on the basis of a teaching signal that specifies the number of target feature occurrences in a trial but not their timing.\n\nUsing this neuron model, we analyze the functional significance of different neuronal response types that have been characterized throughout the auditory brain stem. Extending a previous auditory front-end of on- and offset neurons[2,3] we include populations of neurons that mimic more complex responses such as duration tuning or sustained firing behavior[4]. We quantify which components of these spike-based neural representations of the auditory input streams subserve the detection of specific classes of auditory features. Inspired by the benefits of triphones in various speech recognition systems, we analyze the effects of phonetic contexts for the learning and generalization performance of our phoneme detectors.\n\nOur work provides a biologically plausible neuronal model of segmentation-free phoneme detection that can exploit the dramatic reduction in training data costs provided by count based labeling.",

        "text": "Saccadic suppression refers to reduced visual sensitivity around (micro-)saccades. The sources of suppression remain elusive. One component of it could occur in retina, while another could be extra-retinal. Here we studied saccadic suppression in superior colliculus, SC, which receives both direct and indirect retinal input. We studied suppression across spatial frequency (SF) channels in the superficial layers (receiving direct retinal input) and compared it to deeper layers.\n\nWe recorded from 87 neurons of 2 monkeys. Inside a neuron’s RF, a stationary, vertical Gabor (0.56, 1.11, 2.22, 4.44, or 11.11 cpd) appeared. We measured peak neuronal activity 30-150 ms after grating onset. We characterized superficial-layer visual (V) and intermediate-layer visual-motor (VM) neurons. Trials with grating onset >100 ms before/after microsaccades served as baseline. We compared these to trials with gratings appearing <50 ms after microsaccades, a period of maximal suppression. In separate sessions, we measured reaction times (RT) when monkeys made saccades to the gratings: we detected microsaccades in real-time and presented the gratings at specific times (0-200 ms) after detection. This allowed us to get a time course of saccadic suppression in RT.\n\n85/87 neurons were suppressed in at least 1 SF. VM neurons were twice as strongly suppressed as V neurons. Moreover, VM suppression was SF-dependent: it was strongest in the lower SFs. Suppression was constant across SF for V neurons. Behaviorally, suppression mirrored VM neurons: RT increased during maximal suppression and gradually returned to baseline, but this effect disappeared for high SFs.\n\nThus, superficial layer neurons exhibited weak non-SF-dependent suppression. Deeper neurons had strong suppression that weakened with higher SFs. Deeper neurons were more correlated with behavioral effects. These results illuminate the differential contributions of different visual processing pathways to saccadic suppression.",

In recent studies reporting evidence for WM storage in posterior brain regions but not in prefrontal areas, either simple visual features (grating orientation, color or motion direction) or complex visual patterns were memorized. Here we designed a new experiment to further examine the neural basis of WM. We employed Chinese-native-speakers to do a short-term memory task with Chinese characters as stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cross-validated MANOVA-based multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to identify brain regions which, during the delay period, held information about the memorized characters. We found that both prefrontal and posterior brain regions showed such content-specific information. Thus, these areas are candidate regions for WM storage, with potentially posterior brain regions storing visual details while non-visual information is represented in prefrontal areas.",

        "text": "Although modern cochlear implants (CI) provide good speech intelligibility in quiet environments, in adverse listening conditions their performance degrades. Difficult scenarios are for example cocktail party situations with multiple simultaneous sound sources, noisy environments, music background or reverberations. Sound localization provides important cues to separate sources which enhance speech intelligibility. \nThere is room to optimize coding of binaural information. Binaural models, such as the Lindemann model, can provide a metric to predict source localization abilities. The metric was extended to work with action potentials, which are generated by physiologically inspired models of sound coding provided by an intact inner ear model and a model of electric hearing with different CI coding strategies, enabling a comparison between NH and CI listeners. \nUsing complex signals, such as speech, without noise the spatial resolution of sound localization can be investigated, showing the accuracy in a best case scenario.\nDaily listening environments are always non-ideal. Therefore the metric can take several degrading factors into account. Adding background noise to the clean signal at various ratios the impact on localization can be quantified and the minimal threshold for sound localization determined.\nThe SNR, when localization cues break down for CI-listeners with the FS4 strategy were only 10 dB above the ones for NH, which is surprisingly good. For the NH case, tests revealed that the actual threshold was  ~10 dB lower than the calculated and just above the noise masking threshold.\nIn summary, the model framework introduced here is a valuable tool for the pre-evaluation and optimization of bilateral cochlear implant coding strategies. It provides quantitative values for the strength of the correlation between between left and right ear auditory spike trains. The final evaluation,  has yet to be determined by listening test.",

        "text": "In the entorhinal cortex of rodents fmoving in 2D, the discharge patterns of grid cells are reminiscent of hexagonal spatial lattices with regularly spaced firing fields [1]. When animals run back and forth on a long, but narrow track, grid cells also show distinct spatial firing fields, but, in general, these are not regularly spaced [2]. In many such experiments, distant landmarks are visible; in contrast, making rats run through a maze by inserting walls into an arena changes the firing fields entirely, and the hexagonal grid disappears [3].\nWe hypothesized that grid-cell firing along a linear track corresponds to a linear slice through a two-dimensional hexagonal grid. If such a slice were not parallel to one of its principal axes, one would predict that, for most neurons, the firing fields are not periodically spaced and their peak firing rates change systematically. As the parameters of the putative hexagonal lattice of a given grid cell are unknown, we varied the grid spacing, field width, and peak height, and fit sections through such grids to spike data measured on linear tracks. We find that, indeed, these firing patterns mimic 1D slices through hexagonal grids, similar to results from virtual environments [4]. In addition, there is no preferential alignment of the best-fit grid to the linear-track axis, and right-to-left runs generally lead to different firing fields than left-to-right runs; surprisingly, the orientation of the best-fit hexagonal grid differs as well. This suggests that grid cells have a predisposition to form hexagonal firing rate maps in open environments, but that such maps only become anchored to a common orientation and position when the animal is allowed full freedom of movement in a two-dimensional arena. Such a finding is consistent with the emergence of omni-directional place cells in the hippocampus [5] and the link between the remapping of hippocampal place fields and the lattice realignment of firing fields in grid cells [6].",

Such neurons are called grid cells and are thought to play an important role in spatial navigation [1]. Achieving a metric representation for space requires more than a single grid cell; indeed, it requires an ensemble of neurons organized in separate modules, with each module representing a different spatial scale. In addition, all grid lattices within a module must share the same orientation, which permits decoding through population vectors. In the limit of low firing rates, the highest spatial resolution is achieved when the ratio of spatial scales across successive modules is 3/2, in agreement with experimental findings [2].",

        "text": "Neural populations, such as hippocampal place-cell ensembles or groups of orientation-selective cells in visual cortex are thought to encode external stimuli in their joint firing rate. When assessing the performance of such a code, e.g., for stimulus reconstruction, it is usually assumed that the encoded parameters are essentially static during the integration intervals used for rate estimation. However, for many parameters, say the exact position of a rapidly moving animal, this assumption is wrong and reconstruction bears additional errors. On the other hand, instantaneous decoding and hence immediate stimulus reconstruction are not possible because action potentials are generated with a finite maximal rate. This leads to a trade-off, raising the question how integration time is related to decoding accuracy.\nTo address this question, we study populations of independent, Poisson model neurons with Gaussian tuning curves and study how the average squared error of a maximum likelihood decoder depends on the integration time for dynamic stimuli. This setup is an abstraction of an array of neurons encoding a moving object (Fig. A). By changing the stimulus statistics and the properties of the neural population, we analyze their effect on decoding speed and accuracy.\nIn all scenarios studied, the average error has exactly one minimum at an intermediate integration time. For short decoding times, an analytic lower error bound is given by an exponential function whose decay constant is the population firing rate. For long decoding times, the statistics of the stimulus’ time evolution determine the error, whereas the properties of the neural population become less important. In between, around the minimum error, the stimulus-dynamics dependent part of the error is a quadratic function of the decoding time whose curvature is given by the mean squared stimulus speed (Fig. B). For fixed integration time the mean squared error thus depends quadratically on stimulus velocity.",

        "text": "Spiking neural networks (SNN) are often used to study the effects of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on activity-evoked changes to the synaptic strength between two neurons. For simplicity and compatibility with more abstract rate-based models, the timing of inputs to these networks is often modelled as a stochastic poisson process where the exact timing of spikes is either completely random or has some level of correlation with other inputs. A freely firing postsynaptic neuron that receives correlated inputs is more likely to temporally form strong connections with some of those inputs, but may loose those strong connections as learning progresses. For stochastically firing inputs, the stability of strong connections strongly depends on the size of the correlated group, and learning success is commonly described as the time that a given strong subset of connections survives before decay. \n\nHowever, if inputs to spiking neural networks were instead assumed to encode meaningful information in spaciotemporal patterns instead of varying levels of correlation, many of these perceived problems with STDP can be solved. When inputs are not simply correlated, but have a tendency to fire in a given order, STDP is known to find the minimal group of inputs that still allows a fast postsynaptic response.\n\nWe show the benefits of using spaciotemporal patterns for performing spike timing dependent plasticity in pattern retention time, synaptic stability, sparseness, robustness to size of input group, and signal detection performance under noise. We suggest that stochastic inputs are insufficient to correctly describe the performance of STDP and propose that assumed behaviours of STDP should be reexamined using spaciotemporal patterns.\n",

        "text": "Cone photoreceptors (cones) in the retina play a critical role in color vision. The cone has an outer segment that acts as phototransduction mechanism, an inner segment that shapes membrane potential and a synaptic terminal that communicates with the second-order neurons. Computational models for phototransduction mechanism have been developed based on the experimental analyses of cones. In order to fully understand photoresponse mechanisms such as light sensitivity and response dynamics, we need to develop a realistic computational model of a cone by integrating individual mechanisms of the functional parts.\n\nWe developed a computational model of the cone based on biophysical and physiological properties. The present model consists of three parts: outer, inner segment and synaptic terminal. The outer segment part is described based on the biophysical properties of phototransduction mechanism initiated by absorption of photon. The inner segment part includes the membrane ionic currents based on experimental analyses: $I_h,\\,I_{Kv},\\,I_{Ca},\\,I_K$ and $I_L$ (leakage current). We also introduced the mechanism of calcium concentration by calculating calcium flux. The synaptic terminal part includes a mechanism of calcium concentration and localization of the calcium dependent chloride channel.\n\nThe present model makes it possible to simulate biophysical mechanisms underlying generation of the photocurrent and the photovoltage. The photovoltage of a cone to a light stimulus is not a mirror image of the photocurrent and a prominent depolarizing off-overshoot response is observed. The simulated results suggest that the photocurrent is shaped by the nonlinear membrane conductances and the overshoot is produced by the calcium current. In conclusion, the present model can be used for analyzing the light response properties of the cone photoreceptors quantitatively.",

        "text": " Cone and rod photoreceptors initiate the visual information processing by converting the image focused onto the retina into electrical signals. Rods are sensitive to dim light allowing night vision. Cones are maximally sensitive to either long(L), medium(M), or short(S) wavelength of visible light, which mediate color vision. In the retina, these photoreceptors are forming a distinctive spatial arrangement called a photoreceptor mosaic. The cones are concentrated in the fovea and the cone density decreases with distance from the fovea, while the diameter of the cone increases. Outside the fovea, the rod density rapidly increases keeping almost the same diameter. In order to elucidate the influence of the spatial arrangement on the visual information processing, it is important to develop a realistic model of the photoreceptor mosaic.\n\n In the present study, we developed a method for automatic generation of a realistic photoreceptor mosaic based on the anatomical characteristics. The photoreceptor mosaic is generated by a stochastic algorithm to position L, M, S cones randomly according to given ratio. In order to reproduce the density and the cone diameter, we incorporated the cone-to-cone spacing and the cone diameter obtained from experimental measurements into the model.\n\n As a result, the cone density in the generated photoreceptor mosaic showed a peak in the central fovea and decreased towards the periphery. The cone formed a round circle while changing the diameter with distance from fovea. Both the density and the cone diameter well correspond to those measured experimentally. In conclusion, we have succeeded in generating various types of realistic photoreceptor mosaic models which reproduced cone density, cone diameter, and L,M,S-cone ratio. By integrating this model with photoresponse characteristics, we can make a computational analysis how the spatial arrangement of photoreceptor influence on the visual information processing.",

        "text": "Population imaging in mouse auditory cortex revealed clustering of neural responses to brief complex sounds: the activity of a local population typically falls close to one out of a small number of observed states [1]. These clusters appear to group sets of auditory stimuli into a discrete set of activity patterns and could thereby form the basis for representations of sound categories. However, to be useful for the brain, such representations should be robust against fluctuations in the underlying circuitry, which are significant even in the absences of any explicit learning paradigm [2]. Here we introduce a novel circuit model of mouse auditory cortex to study the emergence of the observed activity cluster states and their structural stability in the presence of synaptic turnover. We find that generic random networks by virtue of their inhibitory recurrent connectivity can group complex sounds spontaneously into essentially discrete sets of activity states. Moreover, these states can display high degrees of stability, even when modifying a substantial fraction of synaptic connections, as long as the basic statistics of connectivity is maintained. We use the insights gained from the analysis of our model to interpret data gathered in a parallel effort, employing chronic two-photon imaging of population activity in the auditory cortex of awake mice.",

        "text": "Information theoretic approaches such as transfer entropy provide nonparametric means to analyze neural circuits. Recently, local information theoretic measures have been proposed that describe information storage and transfer in time, which allows to quantify aspects of the temporal dynamics of information flow in complex networks [1]. These measures appear highly promising for understanding information processing in neural circuits. Complementing ongoing parallel experimental efforts in cat visual cortex [2], we here use a computational circuit model to explore the capacity of these local information theoretic measures in quantifying the formation of sensory representations under the influence of top-down modulatory inputs.\n\nWe model the interaction of area 18 (A18) with the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS; a highly visual motion sensitive area downstream of A18), in detecting the direction of motion in moving gratings and moving dots. To do so, we construct recurrently connected population models for both A18 and PMLS, based on firing rate units. These, again, are recurrently connected with each other to facilitate interaction. Our A18 model reliably detects the direction of motion with and without PMLS but performance significantly improves under the influence of PMLS, consistent with experimental studies, in which PMLS activity was reduced through cooling and neurons in A18 were less selective [3].\n\nFor our analysis of information dynamics, we compute both the local information transfer (LIT) and the active information storage (AIS) for all neurons in the model. We find that an active PMLS facilitates the AIS within A18. When cooled, the AIS drops both for PMLS and for A18. Both the AIS and the LIT depend on time and change when the dots are changing direction. \n\nAltogether, our analysis based on circuit models suggest that local information dynamics can be a useful tool for studying sensory processing in interacting brain regions.",

        "text": "In mammalian visual cortex most neurons are tuned to the orientation of a visual edge, a property called orientation preference. In primates and carnivores, the preferred stimulus orientation forms a largely coherent map across the cortical surface, in which neighboring neurons often prefer highly similar orientations. To explain the formation of this orientation preference map during development, most theoretical models assume a Mexican-hat type structure of neuronal interactions. However, so far Mexican-hat shaped neuronal interactions could not been observed in anatomical or physiological data. Here we show that within our model already a low degree of Mexican-hat type neuronal interactions can lead to the formation of highly coherent orientation preference maps.\nOur network model of the primary visual cortex describes the interactions between the neuronal orientation response properties. We quantified the maps emerging from these dynamics by a coherence measure evaluating the similarity of preferred orientations in neighboring neurons, and analyzed map coherence as a function of the spatial coherence of neuronal interactions.\nCoherent map structure is highly robust against decreasing the level of coherence in neuronal interactions, which we have modeled by superimposing the Mexican-hat with random interaction weights of increasing strength. For a large number of neurons per hypercolumn, already marginally small levels of interaction coherence lead to high levels of coherence in the resulting orientation preference layout, as weak biases of coherence are amplified by the network. For vanishing coherence of neuronal interactions we observe a transition from a coherent map towards a random layout, reminiscent of the ‘salt-and-pepper’ organization observed in several rodent species.\nWe conclude that the highly coherent maps found in several species could result from a Mexican-hat bias of neuronal interactions that is much more subtle than previously anticipated.",

        "text": "In the insect, olfactory sensory input is encoded in the form of spatio-temporal patterns in the projection neurons (PN) of the antennal lobe. These dense and overlapping patterns are transformed into sparse code represented by Kenyon cells (KC) in the mushroom body. \nPrevious efforts of modelling these components of the insect olfactory system have focused on Lotka-Volterra equations to model the experimentally observed sequential activation of PNs [1]. We used this approach to model the KCs, and expanded on this in two ways: First, by adding an online Bayesian inference scheme to model the process through which the code from the PNs is read, transformed and used for decision making by KCs. Second, by modifying the connectivity matrix in the Lotka-Volterra equations to allow clusters of neurons to be activated as a sequence. \nIn our model, the connectivity structure is in accord with experimental findings: the KCs have inhibitory interconnectivity [2], each PN excites a large number of KCs [3], and there is forward and backward connections between the PNs and the KCs[4]. \nThe model was able to qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed activity in the PNs and the KCs, i.e. a dense and overlapping code in the PNs, and sparse coding in the KCs [5]. Additionally, the activity in individual PNs presents the previously reported excitation and inhibition epochs in response to a stimulus [6]. In accord with experimental results [7], we found that the model can recognize odours early during stimulus presentation. This also enabled the model to recognize sequences of odours, switching from one odour to another shortly after the stimulus changed. \nIn conclusion, we found that the combination of established models, such as the Lotka-Volterra equations, with Bayesian inference provides a coherent explanation for a large number of experimental findings in insect odour decoding. \n",

        "text": "Auditory neurons encode temporal information using phase-locked spikes. In the auditory brainstem, coincidence detector neurons involved in sound localization receive bilateral phase-locked synaptic inputs and change their output spiking rates with the interaural time difference. Previous modeling studies suggested that convergence of phase-locked inputs gives rise to periodic oscillations in the membrane potential of the target neuron. This prediction was later confirmed by in vivo intracellular recording from the barn owl's nucleus laminaris (NL) [1]. \nIn this study, we constructed a biologically plausible auditory coincidence detector neuron model that receives phase-locked synaptic inputs and examined how several input parameters affect the oscillating membrane potential. We derived a formula that connects the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the membrane potential with input parameters as: SNR $= MLR^2T$, where M denotes the number of inputs, L is the average spike rates of input fibers, R is the degree of phase-locking (vector strength), and T is the time length of the analyzed waveform [2]. \nBy comparing predicted SNR with experimental data, we found that (1) SNRs of mid-to-high frequency (>2 kHz) NL neurons showed good agreement with theoretical prediction, and that (2) SNRs of low frequency (<2 kHz) neurons are lower than the predicted minimum. These results suggest that low frequency NL neurons may receive significantly fewer inputs than mid-to-high frequency neurons (i.e., smaller M). Our simulations showed that changes in the number of converging phase-locked inputs greatly affect the shape of oscillating potential of the model membrane: A large number of weak synaptic inputs induce stable sinusoidal oscillations whereas a small number of strong inputs lead to more dynamic (noisy) responses. Further investigation is needed to determine the actual number of synaptic inputs in the auditory coincidence detectors in vivo. \n",

        "text": "Voltage sensitive dye (VSD) imaging of multiple neurons becomes one of the most promising up-to-date methods to investigate neuronal network activity. To trace the voltage change of a particular region (ROI) in the VSD recording, the average intensity value of the ROI is calculated in each frame. However, during the experiment the cell sometimes moves and thus, the former ROI does not fit the cell border anymore, causing an artifact in the calculated voltage time course.\nExperimentally, we performed VSD recording in a semi intact preparation of a leech ganglion with an attached patch of skin (Fig. a). When a poker touched the skin (Fig. b) to stimulate the sensory neurons, the skin movement also caused movement of the attached ganglion. The resulting cell movement artifact is clearly visible in the VSD signal corresponding to the voltage time course (Fig. d, red trace) obtained for the pixels of a single cell (Fig. c, region with green border), when no correction for cell movement is performed. \nThe movement correction problem corresponds strongly to image registration in the field of image processing. Image registration methods try to find the best mapping matrix between two images taken from the same scene in different times and/or from different viewpoint [1]. Liu [2] developed an efficient algorithm to solve the image registration problem based on the Lucas-Kanade method for optical flow estimation, which additionally benefits from a coarse-to-fine optical flow estimation to raise the accuracy in finding corresponding points in two consecutive frames. We adapted this algorithm to the cell movement problem.  Applying this method to the dataset allows correcting movement between the frames and subsequently calculating the voltage time course. Comparison between the VSD traces before (red) and after (blue) artifact removal in Fig. d shows that the method successfully removes the movement artifact.\n",

Auditory stimuli consisted of an amplitude modulated carrier frequency of 3, 10 or 16 kHz, in which intensity peaks and gaps of either 50 or 100 ms duration and different intensity levels occurred. AN2 spike rate increased during stimulus peaks and decreased during gaps.\nTo detect change points (on- and offsets of peaks and gaps) in stimulus intensities based on spike responses, we applied four methods: 1. moving average, 2. classification, 3. parametric inter spike interval (ISI) and 4. quotient ISI method. While the first two methods use a smoothed continuous spike rate, both ISI methods are discrete methods analyzing the exact spike times. Furthermore, parametric (1., 3.) and non-parametric (2., 4.) methods can be distinguished.\nWe found that all four methods allow the detection of stimulus changes and show a better performance for detection of peaks than of gaps. The widely used moving average method (1) generally achieved the lowest detection performance, required a long analysis window and relied in most cases on wrong parametric assumptions. In contrast, the quotient ISI method (4) led to the highest detection performance for peaks and gaps. Relying only on the relative timing of two spikes, it also has the advantage of a flexible time scale. Both discrete methods require exact spike times and therefore should be applied only to intracellular or high-quality extracellular recordings. For noisy extracellular recordings, the classification method (2) was found to allow good and fast detection of stimulus peaks, but only a poor detection of gaps.",

        "text": "Maintaining attention on relevant stimuli across eye movements is both critical and natural in our daily life. While recent psychophysical studies have shed light on the dynamics of attention shifts across saccades, we focused on the neuronal correlates of such transsaccadic attention shifts in the visual cortex of non-human primates. We recorded the extracellular activity of single neurons in area MT of two macaque monkeys during a task that required them to make a saccade while maintaining attention on one of four moving random dot patterns (RDPs) in order to respond to a brief direction change in that target RDP by releasing a lever. In the first experiment, the target was either in the neurons’ pre-saccadic receptive field (RF) or directly opposite to it, while in the second experiment, the target was either in the post-saccadic RF or directly opposite to it. By assessing the neuronal responses just before and after the saccade, we were able to determine the time course of attentional modulation of neuronal activity when the target was brought into or moved out of the neuron’s RF by a saccade. Attentional enhancement of neuronal activity emerges within 60 ms after saccade offset when the attended stimulus enters the RF after the saccade. Comparing the results from the two experiments, we find that the locus of peak activity in MT switches back to the cued spatial location at the same time. The behavioral performance of the two monkeys indicates that the performance is impaired around the time of the saccade, but recovers within 50 ms after saccade offset in a manner consistent with the physiological data. Put together, our observations indicate a rapid repositioning of the attentional spotlight in MT’s retinotopic representation across a saccade.",

        "text": "Hippocampal place cells are active at specific locations (place fields) when a rodent is moving through an environment. Recording several of these cells in-vivo allows to reconstruct the trajectory of the animal. During awake immobility and slow-wave sleep a replay of the cell activity on a faster timescale can be observed, in which the relative order of the cell activity is preserved. During such replays, the local field potential is characterized by strong voltage deflections, sharp-waves, combined with high-frequency oscillations (~150-200 Hz), so called ripples. These sharp-wave ripples are thought to play a major role in memory consolidation and emerge from activity bursts in the hippocampal area CA3. The cellular mechanisms underlying replay during sharp waves are not well understood. To investigate these properties we implemented a conductance-based single cell model, in which we can test the influence of inhibitory and excitatory currents on the generation of action potentials. We find that inhibition is crucial for decorrelating the cell output between subsequent ripple cycles.",

        "text": "The principal cells of the medial superior olive (MSO) are coincidence detector neurons in the auditory brainstem that encode interaural time differences (ITDs) by their firing rate. MSO neurons receive one excitatory and one inhibitory input from each side, both of which are phase-locked. It was shown that precisely-timed inhibitory inputs are capable of tuning the timing of best coincidence [1]. For input frequencies up to 500 Hz this result could also be corroborated by a computational model of an MSO neuron [2]. Both approaches show that inhibition alone does not suffice to explain in-vivo data for higher input frequencies.\nUsing the computational MSO model we found that introducing amplitude asymmetries of the ipsilateral relative to the contralateral excitatory inputs had a substantial effect on ITD sensitivity tuning. Furthermore, we show that, despite the existence of fast-activating subthreshold channels in MSO neurons, a linear summation of all synaptic inputs already yields a good prediction of the resulting ITD function of the model [3].\nWe conclude that, a putative asymmetry of excitatory inputs adds another crucial dimension to ITD sensitivity tuning that can explain in-vivo results for higher input frequencies. The possibility to predict ITD tuning functions by a simple linear summation allows for efficiently estimating parameters, such as the level of excitatory asymmetry and the timing and intensity of inhibition, for more complex models of MSO neurons.",

However, the numerical estimation of the mutual information rate is demanding [3] and does not reveal which aspects of the stimulus are encoded. Several studies have identified mechanisms at the cellular and network level leading to low- or high-pass filtering of information, i. e. the selective coding of low- or high-frequency components of the time-dependent stimulus. However, these findings rely on an approximation, specifically, on the qualitative behavior of the coherence function, an approximate frequency-resolved measure of information flow, whose quality is generally unknown.\n \nWe developed a numerical procedure to directly calculate a frequency-resolved version of the mutual information rate. This can be used to study how different frequency components of a Gaussian stimulus are encoded in neural models without invoking a weak-signal paradigm or making undue assumptions on the nature of the neural encoding. We demonstrate its application for paradigmatic descriptions of neural firing like an integrator neuron and a simple setup mimicking a coincident detector cell receiving input from two leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.",

This raises the question how the transmission of information\nabout a weak signal (for example a sensory input) is influenced by a strong background input that\nis not asynchronous-irregular but rather consists of up and down states.\nAs an analytical approach, we consider a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron which is driven\nby dichotomous noise, a stochastic two-state process that serves as an approximation to the up-\ndown input from the network. We derive exact expressions for firing statistics such as rate and\nCV as well as the power spectrum of such a neuron. We then consider an additional weak additive\nsignal and calculate the linear response of the LIF. Combined with the power spectrum, this allows\nus to assess the information transmission properties in the face of strong dichotomous fluctuations\n(representing up-down input), which we compare to the known results for Gaussian white noise\n(representing asynchronous irregular input).\n",

        "text": "Synchronous firing of neurons is a prominent feature in many brain areas. Here, we are interested in the information transmission by the synchronous spiking output of a neuronal population that receives a common time-dependent sensory stimulus. Earlier experimental [1] and theoretical [2] work revealed that synchronous spikes encode preferentially fast (high-frequency) components of the stimulus, i.e. synchrony acts as an information filter. In these studies a rather strict measure of synchrony was used: all neurons in the population have to fire within a short time window. Here, we generalize the definition of the synchronous output, for which only m out of N neurons in the population have to fire in synchrony. We present an analytical approach to characterize the information transfer, by deriving the cross-correlation and the coherence function between the stimulus and the synchronous output. We find that above a critical threshold of synchrony m/N, also the generalized synchronous output acts as a band-pass filter. We confirm our analytical findings by numerical simulations for the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. By analyzing experimental data of P-Units electroreceptors of the weakly electric fish we can show that the filtering effect occurs in real neurons as well.",

        "text": "We study how different effects of intrinsic noise on spikes influence signal transmission by spiking neurons. Therefore we consider populations of neurons driven by a strong common time-dependent signal. The single elements are modeled by Poisson models, where in one case the intrinsic noise either adds and deletes spikes (AD model), whereas in the other model the intrinsic noise leads to spike time shifting (STS model). We show that although the models are indistinguishable on a single neuron level, they exhibit distinct properties of information transmission on the population level. For sufficiently large populations both models exhibit suprathreshold stochastic resonance, an effect where the mutual information rate between the input signal and the summed population response is maximized by a finite intrinsic noise strength. However, the different effects of the noise on spikes determine the population size for which suprathresholdt stochastic resonance is observed and by how much the mutual information rate is increased.\n\nIn this study we estimate the mutual information rate via its lower bound. To this end, we analytically derive the coherence function between input signal and the summed population response and the cross spectrum between different spike trains for the AD model and the STS model, respectively.",

        "text": "Sound localization relies on space dependent phase differences and magnitude modifications in the frequency spectrum of a sound. Until recently these magnitude modifications were thought to be exclusively induced by reflection of high-frequency sounds on external ear structures. Even though birds are capable of sound localization, they lack external ear structures and a high-frequency hearing. However we recently showed that the birds’ head induces the necessary magnitude modifications by diffraction. Here we show that diffraction not only works well with the low-frequency hearing of all birds, but that the avian head is especially efficient at diffracting sounds and their best hearing follows the onset of diffraction cues. Our results suggest that the birds’ low-frequency hearing is strongly linked to sound localization by diffraction, positioning itself opposite the mammalian high-frequency hearing linked to sound localization by reflection.",

        "text": "Many theoretical studies of inhibition have focused on the goal to achieve a balance of excitation and inhibition. But such balance does not yet explain the emergence of powerful computational properties of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We investigate here the functional role of two inhibitory subnetworks in the arguably most common network motif of cortical microcircuits: ensembles of pyramidal cells (PCs) with lateral inhibition, commonly referred to as Winner-Take-All networks.\nIt has been shown in recent theoretical work (Keck et al., 2012; Habenschuss et al., 2012; Nessler et al., 2013) that spike-timing-dependent plasticity installs in this network motif an important and ubiquitously useful computational function: The emergence of sparse codes and Bayesian inference for repeatedly occurring high-dimensional spike patterns of upstream neurons (see Figure 1). This self-organization process can be related to one of the most interesting theoretical principles of statistical learning theory: Expectation Maximization.\nHowever, this link has so far only been established for strongly simplified models with a symbolic implementation of lateral inhibition, rather than through the interaction of PCs with known types of inhibitory neurons. We close this gap and show that the interaction of PCs with two types of inhibitory networks, that reflect salient properties of somatic-targeting neurons (e.g. basket cells) and dendritic-targeting neurons (e.g. Martinotti cells), provides a good approximation to the theoretically optimal lateral inhibition needed for the self-organization of these network motifs. Our analysis suggests a new theoretical perspective on the functional role of dendritic-targeting interneurons: They modulate synaptic plasticity to compensate for unnormalized firing rates of PCs.\nWe provide a contribution towards closing the gap between biological data on diverse types of cortical interneurons and their putative function role.",

Recent work has focused on extracting low-dimensional dynamical trajectories that may underlie such responses. These methods enable visualization and may also provide insight into neural compuations. However, previous work focused on modeling a population’s dynamics without conditioning on external stimuli.\n\nWe propose a new technique that integrates linear dimensionality reduction (analogous to the STA and STC) with a latent dynamical system model of neural activity. Under our model, the spike response of a neural population is governed by a low- dimensional dynamical system with quadratic input. In this framework, the number of parameters grows linearly with population (size given fixed latent dimensionality). Hence, it is computationally fast for large populations, unlike fully-connected models.\n\nOur method captures both noise correlations and low-dimensional stimulus selectivity through the simultaneous modeling of dynamics and stimulus dependence. This approach is particularly well-suited for studying the population activity of sensory cortices, where neurons often have substantial receptive field overlap.",

        "text": "During perceptual decisions the activity of sensory neurons co-varies with choice.  Previous findings suggest that this partially reflects “bottom-up” and “top-down” effects. However, the quantitative contributions of these effects are unclear. To address this question, we take advantage of the observation that past choices influence current behavior (sequential dependencies).    \n\nHere, we use data from two macaque monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task during simultaneous extracellular recordings of disparity selective V2 neurons. We quantify the sequential dependencies using generalized linear models to predict choices or spiking activity of the V2 neurons. We find that past choices predict current choices substantially better than the spike counts on the current trial, i.e. have a higher “choice probability”. In addition, we observe that past choices have a significant predictive effect on the activity of sensory neurons on the current trial. This effect results from sequential dependencies of choices and neural activity alone, but also reflects a direct influence of past choices on the spike count on the current trial. \n\nWe then use these sequential dependencies to dissect the neuronal co-variation with choice: We decomposed the choice co-variation of neural spike counts into components, which can be explained by behavior or neural activity on previous trials. We find that about 30% of the observed co-variation is already explained by the animals’ previous choice, suggesting a “top-down” contribution of at least 30%. Additionally, our results exemplify how variability frequently regarded as noise reflects the systematic effect of ignored neural and behavioral co-variates, and that interpretation of co-variations between neural activity and observed behavior should take the temporal context within the experiment into account. \n",

        "text": "In the mammalian auditory cortex, sound source position is represented by a population of broadly tuned neurons. Their firing is modulated by sounds located in all positions surrounding the animal. Peaks of the tuning curves are concentrated at lateral position, while their slopes are steepest at interaural midline, which allows for the highest localization accuracy in that area.\nThis experimental observations stand against initial expectations of finding a topographic cortical map of the auditory space. It has been concluded that a ''panoramic'' code has evolved to match specific demands of the sound localization task [1]. \nThis work provides evidence suggesting that properties of spatial auditory neurons identified experimentally are a consequence of following a general design principle - learning a sparse, efficient representation of natural stimuli. \nA recording of binaural sounds was performed in different natural settings. Recorded stereo sounds served as an input to a hierarchical sparse-coding model. In its first layer, sounds in the left and the right ear were encoded by a population of complex-valued basis functions which separated phase and amplitude. Both parameters are known to carry information relevant for spatial hearing. Monaural input converged in the second layer, which learned a joint representation of amplitudes and interaural phase differences.\nSpatial selectivity of each second-layer unit was measured by probing the model with natural sound sources recorded at different positions. Obtained tuning curves match well tuning characteristics of neurons in the auditory cortex of a monkey and of a cat.\n\nThis study connects neuronal coding of the auditory space with natural stimulus statistics and allows to form a number of experimental predictions. Additionally, results presented here suggest that cortical regions of seemingly very different or highly specific functions, may implement the same computational strategy - efficient coding.",

The formation of stable representations of spatial/spectral environmental features (stimulus selectivity) along with the related ability to discriminate such features and their combinations is known to be continuously shaped by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, and it has been recently demonstrated that correlation-based inhibitory plasticity has an important role to play in such computations [2]. However, in order to adequately process information, neural circuits must not only develop stable internal representations of perceptual objects, but also reflect and represent the continuous unfolding structure of its input, which is poised with intricate temporal dependencies. Much less is currently known about the acquisition of complex temporal relations between stimuli and the (possibly specialized) role played by different adaptation mechanisms involved in this process. \nIn this work, we study the properties of biologically realistic networks of LIF neurons, with differentially modulated, dynamic excitation and inhibition [2, 3]⁠. Input-specific neuronal assemblies are driven by stimulus sequences that contain complex temporal dependencies and signal propagation throughout these assemblies is gated by transient disruptions of E/I balance, in order to 'prime' the network to learn the underlying transitional probabilities and input statistics through targeted modifications. We explore the representational properties developed by these networks and the impact of the different plasticity rules in shaping the network's learning abilities while maintaining stable global dynamics. Furthermore, we assess the network's ability to extract complex temporal dependency rules between sequence elements.\n",

        "text": "In their natural environment, animals sense and evaluate olfactory cues of time-varying composition and concentration. Their olfactory pathways are adapted to the natural stimulus statistics, thus it is not surprising that odor processing is fast [1]. Honey bees, for example, learn to discriminate odors lasting as little as 200 ms [2]. The neural odor code in these animals emerges within 50ms after stimulus onset and neural representation changes dynamically during and after an odorant is present [1,3]. How is the insect olfactory system optimized to reliably estimate spatial and temporal aspects of the olfactory environment and what are the mechanisms behind rapid odor processing? \n\nIn a previous work Farkhooi et al. [3] have shown that a sparse and reliable stimulus representation emerges naturally in a higher order center - the Mushroom Body (MB) - due to sequential adaptation. A adaptation conductance leads to a strong initial transient and an attenuated phasic response, progressively pronounced across sequential sensory processing stages. At the level of the Antennal Lobe (AL) - the primary olfactory center - odors instead evoke dense spatio-temporal patterns. To investigate odor encoding both at the AL and the MB level, we employ a simple  phenomenological spiking network model of the honeybee olfactory system. The model implements a transformation from a low dimensional dense odorant representation in the AL to a high dimensional sparse representation in the MB.\n\nWe demonstrate how information about the stimulus is present in both encoding schemes, by time resolved classification of neural activity. We show that a strong, transient response component at the AL level establishes a rapid odor code at the MB level for odorant identification and discrimination. Remarkably, persistent information about odor identity is present even after stimulus offset, indicating an odor after image.",

        "text": "Sensory perception can be understood as inference of latent causes underlying observed stimuli [1]. To perform such a task, humans and other animals need to learn the statistics of observations in terms of a generative model with latent variables corresponding to features of the environment. Visual information is represented in the cortex in a hierarchical fashion [2], of which the lowest level is well characterised by V1 receptive fields [3]. High-level object representation in the ventral hierarchy has also been widely studied [4], but understanding of intermediate levels and the nature of their interactions is still in its infancy [5]. \nCognitive-level description of some of the top-down interactions in the visual hierarchy is provided by the results of gestalt psychology, both on the behavioural and physiological [6] levels. We formalised the gestalt effect in a probabilistic generative model of images. Such models have been proposed to describe numerous cortical functions [7], and have also been applied to image processing problems successfully [8]. However, the exact nature of dependence patterns of variables in cortical representations remains debated.\nOur model characterises the statistics of the images in terms of covariance components of latent variables coupled to the pixels of the stimulus through a set of Gabor filters and observation noise. The components, corresponding to gestalts, can be learned from naturalistic images in an unsupervised fashion by an iterative expectation maximisation scheme. \nWe compare the predictions on neural activity by probabilistic models aiming for independent latent representations [9], and our model, which assumes a tree-structured pattern of dependence between latent variables. We test the effect of top-down interactions on V1 activity and demonstrate alterations both in the correlation structure and variances of individual neurons depending on the presence of higher level statistical features of the stimulus.",

        "text": "The Bernstein vision cognitive architecture [1] inspired from biological vision systems and model-driven systems engineering,  aims to develop a platform for multitude of vision applications with self-adaptation and autonomy [2]. To make such system robust and reliable we follow system engineering principles such as physics based modeling, component identification and domain characterization or contextual modeling at every stage: massively parallel hypothesis generation for decomposition, Reasoning and Model updates. In this work our focus is on illustrating how top-down contextual modeling establishes the correspondence between model space and space of possible design configurations for a given vision application with performance specification.  In essence, this can be viewed as an analog to the process in the brain where top-down expectations modulate the choice of invariant feature representations and parameters to facilitate rapid contraction dynamics to a solution.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the generality of the cognitive vision framework, we have used video surveillance and brake light detection in automotive domain as application examples.  In both these applications top-down expectations involving motion and geometry are exploited to design spatio-temporal filters (see for example [3]) that perform statistical hypotheses tests for classification of events. Both these applications utilize illumination and color invariants [4, 5, 6] in order to deal with large variations in lighting and environmental conditions. A common camera noise model is used as the basis for uncertainty characterization of the estimated results [7]. The resulting hypotheses generation subsystems involved deep architectures with filter pipelines involving convolutions followed by pooling/grouping and whose parameters are modulated by top-down expectations.",

        "text": "Neurons in the central nucleus of the main converging station in the auditory midbrain, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) have been shown to display either linear significant receptive fields [1] or both linear and nonlinear significant receptive fields [2].\nIn this study, we used reverse correlation to probe linear and nonlinear response properties of single neurons in the cat ICC. Spiking response were obtained from recordings of anesthetized cats in response to dynamic moving ripple (DMR) stimuli [3]. The DMR sound contains amplitude and frequency modulations and allows systematically mapping neural preferences. \nSpike-triggered average and covariance were computed for the envelope of the DMR, separately for each frequency carrier (range of 0-5.5 octaves). This enables studying processing of the sound envelope, and to investigate whether nonlinearities are more pronounced at the neuron’s preferred frequencies versus other frequencies.\nWe find that greater than half of neurons (n=120), display significant nonlinear response properties at least at one frequency carrier. Nonlinearities are dominant at the neuron’s best frequency. The nonlinear preferences can have either the same or opposite temporal receptive field pattern (e.g. on-off ) as the linear preferences. No relationship to other neural properties such as feature-selectivity, phase-locking, or the like has been found. Thus, these nonlinearities do not seem to be linked to a specific type of neuron but inherent to ICC neurons indicating a diverse range of filtering characteristics.",

        "text": "The primate motor, premotor, and parietal cortex play a crucial role for the planning and execution of hand movements. It has been shown that area F5 in the ventral premotor cortex and the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) carry information about grip type, wrist orientation, and hand shape during movement planning and execution. Here, we are investigating whether AIP and F5, in addition to this categorical information, also encode continuous movements by using spike signals from these areas in a non-human primate to detect and predict complete hand and arm movements and compare these to results obtained with signals from primary motor cortex (M1).\nThe detection of movement phases was carried out with a weighted Support Vector Machine and could be done almost equally accurately from signals in M1 or F5 (95% correct classification with M1, 94% with F5), whereas movement detection was significantly worse from AIP (85% correct). When decoding continuous hand and arm angles with a Kalman Filter, differences between M1 and F5 became more apparent: the mean correlation coefficient (CC) between real and decoded trajectories across all 27 DOF was 0.74 when using signals from M1 for decoding, whereas the CC was 0.67 for signals from F5 and 0.46 for AIP. \nThese results indicate that both F5 and AIP carry information about continuous hand movements and movement timing, whereas AIP is less suited for continuous movement predictions. This information could be useful for future hand prosthetics.",

        "text": "Techniques to record many neurons in parallel have led to analyses of neuronal populations. Here, we focused on the fronto-parietal network of macaque monkey. Three monkeys performed a delayed grasping task where they had to grasp a handle.  All animals were implanted with 128 to 192 electrodes in AIP, F5, and M1. We recorded and analyzed populations of single neuron activity during 11 recording sessions. To reveal functional connectivity between all single neurons, we calculated crosscorrelograms (CCG) of all possible pairs. We applied graph theoretical analysis to the neuronal network. Results were power law-distributed indicating the presence of few highly connected neurons (hubs) in addition to a majority of only sparsely connected neurons. All datasets had significant smallworld values. Power spectrums of CCGs of hub-neurons compared with other neurons showed a strongly increased beta and delta power indicating an important role of oscillations to organize the functional network.",

        "text": "Nociceptors are primary afferent neurons responding to noxious mechanical or thermal stimuli. Spikes evoked from nociceptors are transmitted to the central nervous system and are thought to be perceived as pain. A central question is at what level in the nervous system thermal and mechanical stimuli conveyed by polymodal fibers are processed.\nDetecting and encoding of noxious stimuli involves three main processes: transfer of stimulus in the skin to the receptor endings, generation of a receptor potential to trigger action potentials and generation of spike trains. We assess the processing using a modeling framework. Our framework consists of a stimulus transfer model, a probabilistic model of receptors and a parametric model of the firing rate.\nTo model the spike generation step we examined parametric models of stimulus-driven instantaneous firing rate of polymodal, unmylinated neurons. Each model consisted of two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the rate of an inhomogeneous point process. Two types of ODEs were investigated; one describing a linear adaptation process and another describing nonlinear, divisive adaptation. All neurons were well described by the nonlinear model, while the linear model failed to describe the firing rate variations for 3 out of 53 neurons (p<0.05, Monte-Carlo test). This finding assumed the neurons’ spikes to be generated from a Poisson process. We asked if a more elaborate point process, a Gamma process, captured spiking dynamics more accurately. Yet, modeling spikes by an inhomogeneous Gamma process often failed to capture the spiking properties (p<0.05, Monte-Carlo test, for 8 out of 80 neurons).\nWe are working on integrating a stimulus transfer model and a parametric model of receptor part. Our framework offers a novel method of analyzing and describing nociceptors that may enhance our understanding of different painful states and enable the functional classification of neuron subtypes in the periphery.",

        "text": "Recordings from the auditory receptors of Locusta migratoria reveal that the steady-state rate-intensity curve changes surprisingly little with temperature (Q10=1.5). This robustness benefits insect auditory communication, which has to be sustained over a broad range of temperatures and is predominantly limited by the temperature dependence of chemical rates [1]. The auditory receptors are excited by transduction currents from mechanoreceptors connected to a vibrating tympanum. Using a detailed biophysical model including a tympanal oscillator, as well as transduction and spike-generating membrane dynamics [2], this study explains (i) how a temperature-invariant rate-intensity curve can originate in a model with stochastic ion channels and what role the different noise sources may play; and (ii) how stimulus coding is affected in different frequency ranges. \n\nThe effect of temperature on auditory computation is versatile. Temperature speeds up reaction rates, shapes the spectral content of ion-current fluctuations, and scales the variance of thermal noise. In deterministic models, temperature is known to shift the rheobase, i.e. the spiking threshold [3]. Here we show that close to the rheobase, where the receptors are fluctuation driven, this effect can be compensated by a noise-induced increase in firing rate. In addition to coding the average input amplitude into the average response rate, the grasshopper auditory system also evaluates the temporal structure of species-specific sound messages. To probe how temperature modifies this ability, we calculate the signal-response coherence and spike-train metrics. We find that spike jitter tends to decrease with temperature. More specifically, the signal-to-noise ratio for higher frequencies improves with increasing temperature. Based on the model, the observed effects are dissected and attributed to the temperature dependence of the deterministic dynamical system as well as the stochastic noise processes involved.",

        "text": "Visual working memory (VWM) is a highly limited storage system. A basic consequence of this fact is that visual memories cannot perfectly encode or represent the structure of the world. Many existing computational models of VWM assume that visual memories are noise-corrupted versions of afferent perceptual signals. However, this additive noise assumption oversimplifies the problem facing memory. When errors in visual memory are potentially costly to the organism, it is possible to reduce the probability of certain errors, but this comes at the expense of increasing the probability of other errors. This is a basic consequence of results in information theory (Shannon & Weaver, 2009; Sims, Jacobs, & Knill, 2012). Thus, implicit in the behavioral phenomena of VWM is the concept of a loss function: a mathematical entity that describes the relative cost to the organism of making different types of memory errors. The theoretical construct of a loss function features prominently in research on perception and motor control (Körding & Wolpert, 2004; Maloney & Zhang, 2010; Sims, Jacobs, & Knill, 2011; Wolpert & Landy, 2012), but to date has not been explored in the context of visual working memory. Using this framework, it is possible to define an optimally efficient VWM system as one that minimizes expected loss according to some loss function, while subject to a constraint on memory capacity. By adopting the approach of inverse decision theory (Körding & Wolpert, 2004), I demonstrate that it is also possible to infer or estimate the loss function of human VWM from behavioral data in a delayed recall experiment. The empirical loss function estimated from this process is substantially different from that assumed (implicitly) by existing models of VWM. Consequently, incorporating the construct of a loss function allows for an excellent quantitative fit to empirical data, while enriching the theoretical vocabulary for understanding and explaining human visual memory.",

        "text": "High-level visual representations often display a remarkable degree of invariance with respect to low-level changes such as translation, scaling or lighting conditions. The slowness learning approach assumes that although primary retinal signals are changing rapidly in time, the behaviorally relevant visual elements causing them typically change slowly in time. Thus, invariant representations could be learned by extracting slowly changing information from low-level inputs [1]. In previous analytical work [2], we suggested that this form of learning could be implemented in spiking neurons using spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), but this idea has proven to be difficult to realize in simulations because the “slowness” driving force turns out to be a second-order effect. Here, we demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by combining excitatory STDP with a balance of excitation and feedforward inhibition. To this end, we simulate an integrate-and-fire neuron receiving both excitatory and inhibitory time-varying inputs, with STDP on the excitatory connections and a recently suggested Hebbian rule on the inhibitory connections [3]. The latter establishes a balance of excitation and inhibition, which causes the neuron to emit spikes primarily during upswings of the excitatory drive, i.e., during input transients. STDP caused by these spikes could potentiate the input before and depress the input after the transient, thereby reducing the transient and effectively favoring slower signals since they produce smaller transients. Our simulations show that such a neuron can indeed tune its weights in favor of more slowly changing input signals over a relatively wide range of input signal time constants. We discuss the conditions on the excitatory STDP learning window for which this approach is functional.",

        "text": "Neurons in the hippocampal formation exhibit a variety of spatially tuned firing patterns [e.g., 1]. Whereas place cells in the hippocampus proper are tuned to a single location in the environment, grid cells and band cells [2] in the entorhinal cortex display spatially periodic activity. Head-direction cells are tuned to the animal’s orientation in space and found in several brain regions including the hippocampal formation. A subset of periodically firing cells, referred to as conjunctive cells, also show a tuning to head-direction. The mechanisms by which these different spatial tuning patterns emerge are not fully resolved, although a variety of competing computational models exists for each of them [e.g., 3]. Here we present a new model that can generate all aforementioned spatial firing patterns by a single mechanism. The model consists of a feedforward network with spatially tuned input projecting to a single output neuron. The essential ingredient is an interaction between excitatory and inhibitory Hebbian plasticity [4], where the latter aims to maintain a constant output firing rate by balancing excitation and inhibition. Depending on the relative spatial specificity of the excitatory and inhibitory input, the output neuron develops firing patterns that are similar to those of place, grid or band cells. Furthermore, if the spatially tuned input is endowed with head-direction selectivity, the output tuning resembles that of head-direction and conjunctive cells. A mathematical analysis of the network for a single spatial dimension matches the numerical results. In contrast to attractor models [5], our model predicts that the grid spacing should be robust to global modifications in inhibitory synaptic strength.",

        "text": "Synchronized (i.e., zero time-lagged) oscillations carry functional benefits by dampening variability and enhancing the reliability of responses to stimuli [1]. On the other hand, theoretical work has shown that networks of cortical cells have the ability to generate asynchronous (i.e., time-lagged) spikes [2] and experimental work suggests that this form of coding may be tied to information processing [3]. Here, we employ a computational model to explore the benefits of synchronous and asynchronous oscillations in networks of spiking neurons. Starting from a model of randomly connected leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that generated spontaneous activity (Fig.1A), we injected oscillations by adding a sine wave to the subthreshold membrane potential of all cells. Synchronized oscillations were induced by adjusting this wave such that its phase was the same across all neurons (Fig.1B). For asynchronous oscillations, each neuron received a wave at a unique phase (Fig.1C). We then examined the ability of networks to respond reliably and discriminate between large depolarizing events delivered to random subsets of the population. We show that synchronized cells responded more reliably than asynchronous networks to repeated presentations of a stimulus. On the other hand, asynchronous networks were better able to discriminate between distinct stimuli. These results highlight a trade-off between reliability and stimulus discrimination. Using a principal components analysis, we examined the responses of a network that received two stimuli, each presented ten times. Asynchronous networks yielded trajectories that were clearly separable, while the trajectories of synchronous networks could not be linearly separated. Hence, asynchronous activity was the only regime where a downstream linear classifier could distinguish the two stimuli straightforwardly. We suggest that neuronal networks take advantage of both forms of coding depending on the context and requisites of the task.",

In particular, new insights on collective phenomena, as the repetitive switching among different states of synchrony [1,2], led to novel approaches to neural computation [3,4]. Recent works have shown that the switching dynamics of heteroclinic networks can be used in order to solve complex tasks as bit-wise operations [5]. Nevertheless, whether this switching process could be used to reliably process signals coming from physical sensors is still an open question. Here we demonstrate that heteroclinic networks can robustly perform computation on real-time sensory input. More specifically, we implement obstacle avoidance in an e-puck robot platform. Our results show that computation by neural switching reliably performs navigational tasks and may constitute the basis for more complex autonomous behaviors.",

        "text": "Visual motion perception depends on the responses of direction selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT). The timecourse of these responses exhibits two distinct components: a high amplitude on-response followed by a lower sustained level of activity. For the sustained phase previous studies have documented a multiplicative modulation by spatial attention. Here we focused on comparing MT responses to the onset of attended or unattended moving stimuli. \nResponses of 127 MT neurons were recorded from two monkeys trained to perform a spatial attention task: while the monkey maintained its gaze on a central point, a stationary random dot pattern (RDP) was briefly shown either inside or outside the receptive field (RF) signaling the location of the upcoming “target”. After a brief blank period, two moving RDPs appeared inside and outside the RF. Both moved in one of 12 equally spaced directions. After random periods, the direction (or speed) of each RDP changed. The monkey had to detect the motion change in the target and to ignore the similar changes at the other location to get a fluid reward.\nComparing the population direction-tuning curves during the sustained response when spatial attention was directed into and out of the RF confirmed previous findings: a multiplicative modulation of the MT sustained response. In contrast, while MT on-responses were enhanced by spatial attention for motion directions in or close to the preferred direction, they were suppressed when the stimulus was moving in or close to the anti-preferred direction. This was accompanied by a small decrease in the tuning width resulting in the sharpening of the direction-tuning curve. This suggests that the influence of spatial attention varies between the on- and sustained-response. Attention multiplicatively enhances the sustained response, but exerts a push-pull effect on the transient representation of motion.\n\nBMBF Grant: 01GQ1005C",

        "text": "A recently developed autoencoder model, called Non-Negative Sparse Auto Encoder (NNSAE), is able to extract features that can be nicely interpreted by humans while being simple with respect to its implementation [1]. In this work we analyze the difficult interplay of the three different learning mechanisms, namely a regularization towards non-negativity, a homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (IP) condition [2] and a gradient-descent-based heuristic learning rule, which together constitute the model.\n\nIn a first part we examine the heuristic learning scheme and discuss the difference from an analytically exact gradient descent. Our extensive experimental results show the significant defect of the simplifying heuristics as a general learning rule. Nevertheless we can confirm the superiority of this simplification in experiments for the special case of this model, where the learning rule is combined with a strong regularization for positive weights. In a second part we analyze the diverse behavior of the model with respect to different parameter setting. We show how the reconstruction error of the autoencoder varies under variation of the target mean activity of the IP and variation of the strength of the regularization. We show that these two learning parameters are systematically linked such that for every value of the strength of the regularization there is a different optimal target value for the IP with respect to the model quality. Finally in a third part we explore a new approach to modeling the target of IP in the context of autoencoder networks. We show that learning rules for a more complex and possibly bimodal distribution as target of the homeostasis are analytically tractable using the same techniques as in [2] and we discuss the consequences of this bimodality for the interpretability of the learned features and the quality of the model. \n",

We developed a model of shape tuning in AIP based on cosine tuning to superquadric parameters. However, the model did not fit the data well, and we also found that it was difficult to accurately reproduce these parameters using neural networks with the appropriate inputs (modelled on the caudal intraparietal area, CIP). The latter difficulty was related to the fact that there are large discontinuities in the superquadric parameters between very similar shapes. To address these limitations we adopted an alternative shape parameterization based on an Isomap nonlinear dimension reduction. The Isomap was built using gradients and curvatures of object surface depth. This alternative parameterization was low-dimensional (like superquadrics), but data-driven (similar to an alternative clustering approach that is also sometimes used in robotics) and lacked large discontinuities. Isomaps with 16 or more dimensions reproduced the AIP data fairly well. Moreover, we found that the Isomap parameters could be approximated from CIP-like input much more accurately than the superquadric parameters. We conclude that Isomaps, or perhaps alternative dimension reductions of CIP signals, provide a promising model of AIP tuning. We have now started to integrate our model with a robot hand, to explore the efficacy of Isomap shape reductions in grasp planning. Future work will consider dynamics of spike responses and integration with related visual and motor area models.",

        "text": "Despite the steady advances in the experimental techniques the modelling approach remains the main tool for evaluating the many hypothesis put forth by theoretical neuroscientists. In the current work we aim to study the roles of feed-forward and feed-back connections in visual processing in the thalamocortical system via a large-scale model containing more than 60 000 Hodgkin-Huxley-like neurons. In particular we are interested in the mechanisms underlying figure-ground segregation[1].\nOur work is inspired by a model proposed by Hill and Tononi in 2005[2], but contains multiple adaptations. To realistically capture the dynamics of the thalamocortical system, the model incorporates two cortical areas each consisting of three separate layers, two thalamic areas with the distinction between thalamic core and matrix cells, the thalamic reticular nucleus and the respective inhibitory neurons in all areas. The synaptic connections between the areas are based on our current knowledge about the circuitry within the thalamocortical system. Extensive calibrations were performed to fit the behaviour of the neuron models to in-vivo measurements from different areas. Also the optic-tract firing patters that serve as input to the model are designed to capture the retinal synchrony described in recent studies[3].\nThe model allows us to study the effect that different connections have on the figure-ground computation as it is handed to progressively higher cortical areas. In particular, we compute measures of synchrony and edge enhancement to evaluate how the figure-ground segregation varies in different areas. To establish the role of feedback we manipulate the model in two different ways. First we bias the activity in higher areas to simulate a top-down flow of information to lower areas. Second, we change the strengths and connectivity patterns of feedback connections. We believe that the model can be applied to study a wide range of processes occurring in visual cortex.",

Our target application is the extraction of intrinsic images (albedo, surface shape) from image input, a task addressed previously with the help of statistical models, as in [1]. The system conforms to an architecture presented in outline before [2].  The system models participating sub-modalities (image gray-level, albedo, surface tilt, illumination) as two-dimensional sheets populated locally by feature spaces.  Alternate values of features are represented by units, initial uncertainty in feature values is represented by activity distributions, a tendency to collapse uncertainty is implemented by mutual inhibition between alternate values of the same variable.  Constraints on admissible or preferred constellations of feature values are implemented with the help of excitatory connections.  These come in two forms.  \"Vertical\" connections run between units in different modalities referring to the same image point.  They implement constraints combinations of local variables in different sub-modalities must conform to.  \"Horizontal\" connections run between units referring to different image points within the same modality.  They implement memory for (statistical distributions of) fields of feature values encountered in the past.  The system is subject to instabilities keeping it from converging properly.  We will present several preventive measures, among them a coarse-to-fine strategy, and will show results on runs with successful convergence.  The model is based on a software system written in C++, based on a number of classes for such processes as setting up a new modality field, installing various kinds of connectivity patterns, protocolling and diagnosing the system with a number of graphic tools.  The design of the system is optimized for easy extension to more modalities and more memory patterns.",

        "text": "The perceived color of an object depends not only on the spectral composition of the light reflected from its surface, but also on the visual context such as illumination and background color. Such contextual interactions are thought to underlie perceptual phenomena like color constancy. A possible neuronal basis may be lateral interactions which manifest in contextual influence on the tuning of color-selective neurons in the visual cortex (Wachtler et al., 2003).\nHere we present a model of cortical color processing that predicts color shifts induced by chromatic backgrounds as observed in psychophysical studies. The model assumes that stimulus hue is encoded by a population of neurons with Gaussian tuning curves and preferences distributed in color space, corresponding to the finding of distributed color preferences in primary visual cortex (Lennie et al 1990). Lateral inhibitory interactions between neurons sharing the same color preferences are modeled by a Difference-of-Gaussian interaction kernel. No interactions between color channels are assumed.  Due to the contextual modulation the readout of the population response showed systematic shifts in the encoded stimulus hue when stimuli were presented on colored backgrounds. The induced shifts depended on the distance between stimulus and background hues in colorspace, but were always directed away from the hue of the background. The specific shapes of the resulting induction effects strongly depended on the configuration of the population code, like the density distribution and widths of the tuning curves. Specifically, anisotropic distribution of tuning curves resulted in dependencies of the induction strength and distribution on the location in color space, in line with effects observed in psychophysical studies.  The results indicate that important computations in color vision that lead to perceptual hue shifts can be realized using simple neural mechanisms when color is represented by a distributed code.",

        "text": "In vision science, image driven models relate image content to behavior on certain observation tasks. These models generally follow a common structure: a subband decomposition (e.g. Steerable Pyramid, Gabor filter bank) followed by non-linear operations (e.g. point nonlinearities, divisive contrast normalization, Minkowski norm pooling) followed by a decoding or readout stage.\n\nMost models of early vision fit their parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. While this provides point-estimates of parameters, and can provide rough estimates of variance, its model description lacks sufficient detail to explore parameter interactions. We describe a method of representing models of early vision as Bayesian graphical models. This allows sampling of the posterior distribution of the parameter space using MCMC methods. These sampling procedures provide insight not only in point estimates, but also accurate estimates of parameter variances and interactions.\n\nThis work builds on work by Dold (2012) whose analysis showed frequency sensitivity artefacts. We explored this problem further, discovering that subband decompositions represent frequencies at or between filter peak-frequencies very differently, and these representations get treated differently by non-linearities, essentially leading to frequency- and orientation-aliasing. We solve this problem using a novel image-decomposition technique which samples the frequency and orientation domain (quasi) continuously and uses point process statistics to generate robust image sampling distributions.\n\nWe aim at integrating this new decomposition with our early-vision model and continuing our model analysis. Through improvements to general model architecture and analysis methods we take a step towards better, more robust models of early vision.\n\n",

        "text": "A longstanding hypothesis claims that spatio-temporally structured input in neural circuits enhances precision and reliability of spiking responses. While studies in single neurons well support this hypothesis both experimentally and theoretically (e.g. [1-3]) the impact of input structure on the dynamics of recurrent networks is not well understood. The high dimensional and often chaotic dynamics of large recurrent networks requires a type of analysis that is sensitive to recurrent interactions and characterizes the networks collective dynamics [4-11]. \n\nTo address this challenge, we here demonstrate how the analysis of dynamical stability and entropy production can be generalized for examining balanced networks driven by a stream of input spike trains. Previous studies of the dynamic stability of the balanced state used a constant external input [4-9] or white noise [10-11].  An analytical expression for the Jacobian of the flow enables us to calculate the full Lyapunov spectrum. Using a single neuron model in which action potential onset rapidness can be adjusted we solved the dynamics in numerically exact event-based simulations and calculated Lyapunov spectra, dynamical entropy production rate and attractor dimension. We examined different scenarios to study the transition from constant to stochastic input, varying the Poisson rate and/or Poisson coupling strength, while keeping the firing rate of the driven population fixed. \n\nWe demonstrate a suppression of chaos by input spike trains, for the first time extending studies of chaotic rate models to spiking neuron models [12-13]. This finding holds both for variations of input Poisson rate and Poisson coupling strength and is robust to deviations from Poisson statistics. Our study provides insight into the role of sensory streams in shaping the chaotic dynamics of large networks.",

        "text": "First spike latencies and stationary inter-spike time intervals have been extensively used to characterize the information transfer capacities of various sensory neurons [1-5]. However, neither the importance of the contributions of these two response properties to encoding particular stimulus features nor their relation to the molecular organization of the sensory neurons are well understood.\nHere, we computationally studied information transfer properties in terms of the First Event Latencies (FEL) and stationary Inter-Event time Intervals (sIEI) of the neurotransmitter release events at inner hair cell ribbon synapses. In particular, we considered mutual information carried by FEL/sIEI about intensities of sound tone bursts applied in silent background. We investigated how the mutual information depends on the presynaptic active zone organization, which was suggested to vary considerably from synapse to synapse [6,7]. We used a computational model which took into account the main aspects of the presynaptic active zone organization relevant for neurotransmitter release: release face topography, kinetics of the presynaptic Ca2+ channel gating, kinetics of Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+ sensor of exocytosis, and synaptic vesicle replenishment.\nWe found that, depending on the presynaptic active zone organization, information carried by the FEL is either higher or lower than the information carried by the sIEI. Moreover, the theoretical lower bound for the information carried by the FEL is always considerably higher than 0 bits, whereas the information carried by the sIEI can be arbitrarily close to 0 bits. In the later case, the transient part of the response carries the greatest part of information about the stimulus intensity in the whole release event pattern. We also found that subsequent sIEIs are weakly correlated in all cases considered. Thus, full information transfer rate by a neurotransmitter release pattern in steady state is determined mainly by the sIEI.",

        "text": "During perception the brain combines sensory information with an internal model representing prior information about the outside world [1]. While the mathematical concept of probabilistic inference has previously been suggested as a framework for understanding this process [2][3], deriving testable predictions for the spiking activity of sensory neurons has been a challenge because neither the internal model that the brain has learnt, nor how it represents probabilities, is readily available.\n\nWe show how to derive such predictions in the context of psychophysical tasks without relying on specific assumptions about how probabilities are represented in the brain. Assuming that sensory neurons represent posterior probabilities, Bayes' rule implies a symmetry between bottom-up and top-down connections. Based on this insight we derive empirically testable relationships between stimulus-evoked quantities like choice probability or signal correlation and choice-related observables like tuning curve slope or noise correlation. Crucially, these relationships differ from the predictions of the signal-detection framework that is traditionally used to understand perceptual decision-making [3] and therefore allow us to differentially test these two frameworks using empirical data. Furthermore, we show how to use the observed noise correlations to infer the 'principal components' of the internal model used by the brain to perform the task.\n\nWe apply our framework to the noise correlations reported in a task-switching paradigm [5]. This reveals that the internal model used by their monkeys consists of a superposition of stimulus detection and discrimination components and reflects a large degree of task uncertainty (Fig 1A). Applying our framework to the output of a previously presented neural-sampling-based model [6] (Fig 1B) we make predictions for the effect of perceptual learning and can explain the reduction in average noise correlation observed empirically [7] (Fig 1C).",

        "text": "Spontaneous activity and trial-to-trial variability in neocortical recordings have long been assumed to reflect intrinsic cortical noise. However, it has been shown that spontaneous activity is highly structured in space and time (1,2), contributes to trial-to-trial variability of subsequent evoked sensory responses (3) and predicts subsequent perceptual decisions (4). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that variability in neural activity decreases with stimulus onset (5). These findings are consistent with the „sampling hypothesis“(6), according to which instantaneous population activity corresponds to samples from a posterior distribution over the represented variables.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that many of these phenomena can be accounted for by a deterministic self-organizing recurrent neural network model (SORN, (7)). The network consists of excitatory and inhibitory McCulloch-Pitts neurons learning a model of structured input sequences through a combination of STDP and homeostatic forms of plasticity. When confronted with previously unseen ambiguous inputs, the network approximates a Bayesian inference operation by appropriately combining the sensory input with prior knowledge encoded in the learnt network parameters. Furthermore, the network matches many of the key findings on spontaneous activity and neural variability outlined above and samples frequent input sequences during phases of spontaneous activity. While doing so, it also reproduces the lognormal statistics of synaptic connection strengths observed in cortex. The simplicity of our model suggests that these features are canonical properties of recurrent networks learning with a combination of STDP and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Overall, our results demonstrate that the complex dynamics of a deterministic self-organizing recurrent neural network can approximate sampling-like inference while capturing key features of neural variability at the single unit and network levels.",

Here we show that such balance has a surprising effect on information transmission: Synaptic unreliability – which is ubiquitous in cortex and usually thought to impair neural communication – actually increases the information rate. We show that the beneficial effect of noise is based on a very general mechanism which contrary to stochastic resonance does not rely on a threshold nonlinearity.",

        "text": "While the replay of hippocampal place cell sequences during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) has been proposed as a potential correlate of memory recall [1], recent results also suggest a role in memory-guided decision-making during goal-directed behavior [2]. Inspired by these observations, we present a novel computational model of how hippocampal place-cell sequences during awake sharp-wave ripples determine a navigational goal. The model is based on two main computational properties: (1) Continuous attractor dynamics during sharp-wave ripples generate sequential activity of place cells, progressing toward the peak location of spatially heterogeneous input to CA3. (2) The heterogeneity in CA3 inputs is caused by reward-modulated plasticity in the inputs to dentate granule cells [3]. This form of plasticity biases DG place cell firing rates during theta rhythm, progressively strengthening DG inputs to CA3 place cells with fields near the reward location. \nIn contrast to previous accounts of hippocampal replay based on sequence learning (e.g., [4]), sequential activity in our model does not require previous experience of the corresponding trajectories. In fact, the constructive nature of the sequences can be viewed as a predictive process biased by memory. The model makes an explicit proposal about the role of awake sharp-wave ripple activity in spatial memory, consistent with recent observations of impaired goal navigation after SWR disruption [2], and suggests a mechanism for the goal-predictive nature of sequential place-cell activity in open-field type mazes [5].",

        "text": "Knee-Ankle-Foot-Orthoses (KAFOs) are modular lower-extremity orthoses prescribed to people with gait disability. KAFOs should support, correct and assist the movement of the corresponding affected joints. Traditional controllers depend on non-adaptive thresholds to switch between selected control values; therefore, they lack flexibility to adjust to common disturbances (i.e., floor unevenness, obstacles, ramps) in a satisfactory way. Novel approaches include active elements, which do not directly act on the movement. Instead they allow continuous adjustment of parameters like the affected joint's damping, leading to new challenges for the controller of such actuators.\n\nTo use the full continuous range the active element offers and to overcome shortcomings of traditional control approaches, adaptive methods like artificial neural networks (ANN) are applied. These methods can manage the active element's flexibility and the high neuromuscular variability within specific patient groups, allowing individual support of a wider range of patients. Model based tracking[1,2] of the user's gait allows to overcome the problems of finite state switching.\n\nThis study evaluates a combination of reflexive feed forward controller[3] with history dependent internal motion models for gait switching. A reflexive core allows the controller to react immediately to external influences. Gait models continuously track the user's gait and switch gait support accordingly. The controller operates a KAFO based on a controllable hydraulic damper, derived from OttoBock's C-Leg©. \n\nOur investigations indicate, that the presented gait models are an accurate and fast adaptive method for detection of the current gait. They fit well into and extend the used paradigm of adaptive modular neuro-control[3]. The reflexive feed forward controller benefits from the combination with the history dependent gait models in kind of enhanced precision via the motion model's detailed knowledge of the gait dynamics.",

Here we show, through information theoretical analysis of LFP and single unit recordings, that functional connectivity maps between entorhinal cortex neurons display dynamic reconfiguration between theta and slow oscillations in vivo. At the level of field potentials, the flow information follows fixed paths within and between cortical layers in a brain state-dependent manner. In contrast, at the single cell level, the information flows in continuously reconfiguring networks, without changing the global amount of transferred information. We conclude that information processing operates differently at different scales: it is \"liquid\" at the neuronal scale, whilst it follows stable pathways at the network scale. Both modus operandi are brain-state specific, with theta oscillations being associated generally to enhanced information transmission between cortical layers.",

        "text": "The interplay of excitatory and inhibitory activity in neuronal populations is finely regulated within cortical layers. One of the key regulatory mechanisms is gain modulation, in which the amplitude of response changes while the cell's selectivity remains unaffected [1]. However, given the non-linear integration that occurs in dendrites, it is unclear how gain is modulated when the input is located at synaptic locations located throughout the dendritic arbor. \n\nFor investigating and manipulating this balance of activity, optogenetics is a powerful tool due to the fine temporal and spatial precision it provides. Furthermore, due to the development of excitatory (e.g. channelrhodopsin ChR2) and silencing opsins (e.g. halorhodopsin NpHR), dendritic arbors can be optically coactivated independently. This provides the opportunity to examine how competing excitatory and inhibitory inputs for differing spatial and temporal patterns of activation modulate gain in individual neurons. \n\nWe investigate this relation by testing optical activation in abstracted neuron morphologies that include models of ChR2 and NpHR [2,3]. By extending a simple ball-and-stick model, we created a family of neural morphologies that varied in polarity and branching of the dendritic trees. External driving input is provided as current injection or as multiple synaptic-like events at locations on dendrites, rather than the soma, to mimic inputs for both in vitro and in vivo scenarios. Using these models, we can predict the ability of a neuron to modulate gain based on its dendritic morphology. Finally, we test detailed biophysical models of Layer 5 Pyramidal cells and Layer 4 stellate cells and confirm our findings from abstract models. \n\nOur results highlight the role of dendritic morphology and the localized contribution of excitatory and inhibitory activity in gain modulation. Importantly, our model allows us to form experimental illumination strategies that are tailored to neuronal morphology.",

        "text": "During the last two decades various methods such as high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been developed for the treatment of oscillations associated with several pathological conditions, e.g. in Parkinson's disease [Perlmutter and Mink 2006]. These methods have been traditionally based on open-loop strategies, that is on fixed, predetermined stimulation parameters. They are highly effective in quenching the aberrant oscillations and, thus, in alleviating the clinical symptoms. At the same time, however, they introduce undesirable side effects and in most cases they do not restore the network transfer function. Recently, adaptive control strategies have emerged, which promise to increase the efficacy of the existing stimulation methods for the control and correction of the network activity dynamics [Priori et al. 2013]. \n\nHere, we investigate the effects of adaptive, closed-loop control schemes on networks of spiking neurons. Specifically, we design an appropriate control strategy, based on delayed state-feedback to quench sparse or stochastic oscillations, which closely resemble the pathological oscillations and are known to be robust compared to synchronous regular activity [Brunel and Hakim 2008]. Our control protocol is able to sufficiently suppress these stochastic oscillations and to drive the network in an asynchronous irregular regime. Importantly, the network transfer function, defined as the ratio of the population rate response to incoming stimuli, is also recovered. Our results thus suggest that adaptive state-feedback control is a promising strategy to design brain stimulation protocols to correct the aberrant dynamics without inducing strong side-effects.",
