Many analytical tools and computational models have been provided on the Internet, and most of them are open-access for researchers. However, using these software resources usually requires a time-intensive process for preparing the appropriate computer environment. Problems caused by differences between versions of operating systems, of software, or lack of library files, happen quite often. So, we have been providing a virtual machine environment for neuroscience research called Simulation Platform (Sim-PF, http://sim.neuroinf.jp) (Yamazaki et al., 2011) which permits the use of computational models and data analysis tools on the Internet without any barrier. Accessing the platform through a web browser automatically starts a virtual machine with the Linux operating system. Then, a script is executed which downloads the model or data files and runs them on the virtual machine (VM). The server system providing the VM was developed using Guacamole 0.8.4 and OpenNebula 4.12. We have been developing online simulation pages for ModelDB contents, and many models registered on ModelDB can be easily run on a web browser. Furthermore, we are providing new content including new data analysis tools from MATLAB central (Fig.1) and open source image processing software.", "authors": [{"uuid":

scientists and software developers to promote reproducible research and structured data sharing in neuroimaging. Using an open collaboration model, the TF has: 1) established core standards and terminologies for data sharing and information representation in neuroimaging (e.g., BIDS [1], NIDM [2], [3]), 2) engaged commercial and research partners to distribute public data (e.g., FCP-INDI [4], Openneuro on Amazon S3), 3) supported the development of open software (e.g., BrainSpell, DataLad, Neurodebian [5], Neurovault [6], Nipype [7]), 4) coordinated work across many projects and initiatives (e.g., AFNI, CBrain, Center for Reproducible Neuroscience, COINS, UCI Conte Project, FSL, Loris, NIF, NITRC, ReproNim, SchizConnect, SPM, XNAT, etc), and 5) supported hackathons and open science efforts. This comprehensive ecosystem continues to expand and work together to solve fundamental problems in information representation and dissemination. While these tools and resources are now used by many neuro imagers, several challenges still remain: a) limited open sharing of code and data, b) the cognitive load of information complexity is daunting for most scientists, c) the scientific currency of publications still undervalues reproducibility and reusability, and d) the increasing scale of data disenfranchises groups with limited computational resources. The community has to tackle these social challenges to improve scientific output.", "authors": [{"uuid": "bcfaa633-3048-4e1e-bd09-9425848628d5", "firstName": "Tibor", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Auer", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "tibor.auer@rhul.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "eb607cb0-0846-4b8d-8535-bc2167f61b0a", "firstName": "Guillaume", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Flandin", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "g.flandin@ucl.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "48bb960a-a43c-451d-9967-f1f15a34fea3", "firstName": "Satrajit", "middleName": "S", "lastName": "Ghosh", "affiliations": [2], "position": 2, "mail": "satra@mit.edu"}, {"uuid": "ec11a1da-adf3-40c0-abd3-ada51ca81a28", "firstName": "Tristan", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Glatard", "affiliations": [3], "position": 3, "mail": "tristan.glatard@concordia.ca"}, {"uuid": "82019692-5132-4f4d-b823-0e2100f6e610", "firstName": "Krzysztof", "middleName": "J", "lastName": "Gorgolewski", "affiliations": [4], "position": 4, "mail": "krzysztof.gorgolewski@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "6e4a707b-e0ea-4f6c-85de-16ea28dd8994", "firstName": "Yaroslav", "middleName": "O", "lastName": "Halchenko", "affiliations": [5], "position": 5, "mail": "yaroslav.o.halchenko@onerussian.com "}, {"uuid": "9c20153a-53f0-412d-93a2-05df61fc9e9e", "firstName": "Karl", "middleName": "G", "lastName": "Helmer", "affiliations": [6], "position": 6, "mail": "helmer@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu"}, {"uuid": "aa4c364d-2394-491f-b686-c3b38459362a", "firstName": "Dorota", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Jarecka", "affiliations": [2], "position": 7, "mail": "djarecka@mit.edu"}, {"uuid": "79dbc7a3-e19d-46d4-89d7-a950c6cb5dec", "firstName": "David", "middleName": "B", "lastName": "Keator", "affiliations": [7], "position": 8, "mail": "dbkeator@uci.edu"}, {"uuid": "6518ece6-ed0d-4b07-b0e6-28496739ae8a", "firstName": "Camille", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Maumet", "affiliations": [8], "position": 9, "mail": "c.m.j.maumet@warwick.ac.uk "}, {"uuid": "ce60e01a-53d5-4976-853e-a25287b1f818", "firstName": "Thomas", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Nichols", "affiliations": [8], "position": 10, "mail": "t.e.nichols@warwick.ac.uk "}, {"uuid": "786b00c8-0e91-449e-98ff-dbbcb3929611", "firstName": "Smruti", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Padhy", "affiliations": [2], "position": 11, "mail": "smruti@mit.edu"}, {"uuid": "b94d6b48-a05f-453d-8127-41c1c6662647", "firstName": "Jean-Baptiste", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Poline", "affiliations": [9], "position": 12, "mail": "jbpoline@berkeley.edu"}, {"uuid": "4aed2a65-c6db-4e69-b072-0027a50abbc5", "firstName": "Jessica", "middleName": "A", "lastName": "Turner", "affiliations": [10], "position": 13, "mail": "jturner63@gsu.edu"}], "sortId": 2, "topic": "General neuroinformatics", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "b46f188a-bb25-4c14-ae9d-2130309e909c", "country": "United Kingdom", "section": "Royal Holloway University of London", "address": "Egham, TW20 0EX", "department": "Department of Psychology", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "fbecc58c-c56e-4a85-956e-4a0bc86c02de", "country": "United Kingdom", "section": "Institute of Neurology, University College London", "address": "WC1N 3BG", "department": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "97802a57-6117-4f73-96df-8e5726ee029e", "country": "USA", "section": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "address": "Cambridge, MA 02139", "department": "McGovern Institute for Brain Research", "position": 2}, {"uuid": "5ba0c6f8-95b0-4726-b91c-5ed2831c5d7a", "country": "Canada", "section": "Concordia University", "address": "Montreal", "department": "Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering", "position": 3}, {"uuid": "66231a8b-7e38-4009-a326-96b3e9721e5f", "country": "USA", "section": "Stanford University", "address": "Stanford, CA", "department": "Department of Psychology", "position": 4}, {"uuid": "8ecc02bb-dbd0-4422-aae3-afe1892da81d", "country": "USA", "section": "Dartmouth College", "address": "Hanover NH 03755", "department": "Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences", "position": 5}, {"uuid": "94db1043-7cd4-4300-a775-b957b128ab58", "country": "USA", "section": "Massachusetts General Hospital", "address": "Boston, MA 02114", "department": "Athinoula A.

NIJC coordinates activities in Japan within Neuroinformatics (NI) research, supports researchers to operate platforms (PFs), provides J-Node portal for smooth integrations of each PFs and develops NI tools and infrastructure, etc.\n\nWe are developing a NI tools \u2018XooNIps\u2019, which is a base platform system for accumulating and sharing neuroscience data with metadata. XooNIps is an extended module of XOOPS, which provides general purpose database and peer-review workflow. XooNIps has been used for J-Node portal and various PFs such as Visiome PF and Simulation PF.\n\nRecently, to improve sustainability of databases stored across J-Node portal and individual PFs, we started to assign DOI to articles and research data. For articles, we updated XooNIps of J-Node portal to the latest version, defined metadata schema for the articles, and then registered the abstract PDFs of the international workshop AINI with DOIs. For research data, many PFs have been using the metadata with free description so we needed to introduce a standard form.

In modelling cognitive phenomena, e.g. with the aim of predicting imaging signals,  the concept of a neural population is a useful abstraction level. The biological plausibility of these models can be provided  by using techniques from statistical physics: population density techniques.  Recent simulations have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach: with simulator DIPDE  [1] Cain et al have implemented a highly efficient version of the Potjans-Diesmann  [2,3] model of a cortical column.\n\nMIIND [4] offers support for two-dimensional models, such as adaptive-exponential-integrate-and-fire, Fitzhugh-Nagumo, Izhikevich and other neurons; we have recently implemented an algorithm that can model populations that are subject to non-Poisson spike trains  [5](e.g. gamma distributed spike intervals). Currently, there is a trend to simplify highly complex conductance-based models to simpler ones that are qualitatively similar. Our two-dimensional algorithms are ideally suited to model populations of such neurons. MIIND  (http://miind.sf.net) is implemented as a C++ framework with an MPI backend that allows users to define their own algorithms, and comes with an XML-like markup language for algorithms that have already been implemented, thereby removing the need for users to learn C++.

It has different layers including convolutional, pooling and fully connected. Convolutional and pooling layers have key role in the extraction of features while fully connected layer is used for the purpose of classification. CNN is quite popular in other applications especially image, speech and text [1-3], however it is not quite popular in neuroscience because CNN needs a lot of data for the purpose of training. \nWe proposed a CNN model for neuroscience data which takes estimation values of fMRI data as input extracted through General linear model (GLM) instead of raw data.

BCI mainly developed for rehabilitation and helping people with disabilities. Motor imagery (MI) can be a part of the input for BCI based application. MI is a form of activity of brain wave that contained some certain information that can be recorded through a medical instrument called electroencepalograph (EEG). EEG widely used because of its non-invasive characteristic and doesn\u2019t give any side-effect to the user. Pattern recognition is needed to translate any kind of information from MI. The objective of this research is to introduce an alternative method for feature extraction using image representation that will be used for deep learning as a classification method. In this study, we proposed continues wavelet transform (CWT) combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and stack autoencoder (SAE) to create a model for classifying motor imagery EEG signal. CWT was used to convert EEG signal into 2D image for CNN input.  Dataset 2b from BBCI IV is used for the experiment. The result shows that the model has 78% accuracy. Hence, this model can be an alternative solution to classify motor imagery EEG signal.", "authors": [{"uuid": "66947e19-cee4-4e0c-9d3d-08911f676aed", "firstName": "Anggit", "middleName": "Ferdita", "lastName": "Nugraha", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "anggitferdita.mti15@mail.ugm.ac.id"}, {"uuid": "66e262bd-c80f-4cfa-aaef-fc435f63cead", "firstName": "Brahmantya", "middleName": "Aji", "lastName": "Pramudhita", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "brahmantya.aji.p@mail.ugm.ac.id"}, {"uuid": "4472e817-ddcc-4462-b5b5-0cd83f2767a0", "firstName": "Noor", "middleName": "Akhmad", "lastName": "Setiawan", "affiliations": [0], "position": 2, "mail": "noorwewe@ugm.ac.id"}, {"uuid": "a0ed7cdc-88c1-41c2-8537-23d091d1db2e", "firstName": "Hanung ", "middleName": "Adi", "lastName": "Nugroho", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "adinugroho@ugm.ac.id"}], "sortId": 65538, "topic": " Brain-machine interface", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "e502e7f1-aec5-4f16-a9b1-0d4f6fc5dcee", "country": "Indonesia", "section": "Universitas Gadjah Mada", "address": "Yogyakarta", "department": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:25.882Z", "references": [], "acknowledgements": null, "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/fd930602-0232-4f2c-9868-57f4bcda9700/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0009", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "fd930602-0232-4f2c-9868-57f4bcda9700", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/fd930602-0232-4f2c-9868-57f4bcda9700/stateLog", "title": "Multiscale measurements of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)- the morphometric tangram for non-invasive neuromodulation target", "text": "Background: Image-guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) presents a convincing therapeutic efficacy for treatment-resistant depression. However, considering the age-related cortical atrophy, the elevated heterogeneity within DLPFC might be one of the potential causes of failure of neuromodulation trials in late-life depression. The aim of this study is to examine whether the age-related effects on morphometry of subregions of DLPFC were differently across age groups.\nMethods: 214 cognitively normal adults (aged 18-80 years, Clinical Dementia Rating scale equal to 0) were selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). The multiscale measurements of left DLPFC morphometry include cortical thickness (mm), cortical area (mm2) and cortical volume (mm3). Linear regression was employed to examine the age-related effects on the morphometry of left DLPFC.\nResults: Chronological age was negatively correlated with the cortical volume (Gray matter: r = -0.325, p < 0.001; White matter: r = -0.282, p < 0.001) and area of left DLPFC (r = -0.286, p < 0.001), but positively associated with cortical thickness (r = 0.221, p = 0.001).\nConclusion: Age shows the differential effects on the DLPFC morphometry with multiscale measurement. The positive relationship between age and cortical thickness might be due to the bending of medial frontal gyrus, which may lead to diverse efficacy of rTMS as well.", "authors": [{"uuid": "369a2059-f3a6-443c-aaac-4f6d54bc8750", "firstName": "Hanna", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Lu", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "hannalu@cuhk.edu.hk"}], "sortId": 65539, "topic": " Clinical neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "d1ce5a1f-0f3d-4e8f-8fb2-fc67b691ceb8", "country": "Hong Kong SAR, China", "section": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong ", "address": null, "department": "Psychiatry", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:26.078Z", "references": [], "acknowledgements": null, "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/8077e04e-81a8-4cc5-9c1d-9bf1d78a9461/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0010", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "8077e04e-81a8-4cc5-9c1d-9bf1d78a9461", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/8077e04e-81a8-4cc5-9c1d-9bf1d78a9461/stateLog", "title": "Towards a Mental State Model of Workload Performance from fNIRS Brain Haemodynamic Signal Analysis", "text": "One of the roots of psychological distress is chronically high mental workload in today\u2019s fast paced society.  Studies have shown that negative moods indicative of stress affect the cognitive brain functions such as reasoning and decision making. Stress affects the emotional state and cognitive performance of many employees at work. We propose preliminary work towards a mental state model of cognitive performance at the workplace based on analysis of brain haemodynamic signal measurements with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). If deployed at the workplace, such a model has potential to measure and warn about a worker\u2019s mental state and mental capacity which in turn may lead to better job planning to enhance work efficiency and reduce risk of accidents from human error.  Our model will predict workload difficulty and performance from fNIRS haemodynamic measurements at a personalized level. We anticipate that mood states will modulate an individual\u2019s workload-performance model. The preliminary model will be developed from temporal and amplitude properties of brain haemodynamic responses of the prefrontal cortex for a range of working memory workloads and negative to neutral mood states. Task accuracy and response time will be the performance assessed. We anticipate that each subjects\u2019 mental effort and performance may be inferred along a workload difficulty spectrum under diverse mood states.

The new generation of 3-D rodent brain reference atlases and accompanying tools provide new opportunities for spatial co-registration (integration) and comparison of different types of brain images, including microscopic images of serial sections through the brain. \nSpatial registration of serial 2-D section images to a 3-D reference space using affine transformations is useful and relatively practical to implement, whereas non-linear and thus potentially more accurate methods are complex and in most cases require spatially coherent input data. 3-D reconstruction of serial 2-D images is manageable if block face imaging is used, but otherwise quite tedious. \nWe here present a methodological framework to non-linear registration of purely 2-D (not spatially coherent) images to 3-D space. The framework is built to address variability in acquisition parameters (cutting plane, single section or stack, number of slices in a stack, distance between successive slices, etc\u2026) between experiments. \nWe initially employ a global manual anchoring of the section material within the reference coordinate space followed by estimation of a multi-level transformation using intensity- and/or landmark- similarity metrics.

The alpha (8\u221212 Hz) asymmetric index [5] was computed for the homologous frontal electrodes (F3\u2212F4, F7\u2212F8). The behavioral results of memory recall found that reaction time deceases of 20.2 seconds with increased response accuracy of 31.9% mean in experimental group compared with control group. The subjective self-emotional ratings of valence dimension in experimental group higher compared with control group. The frontal alpha asymmetry index shows relative more left frontal activity in experimental group than control group. In conclusion, visual color of learning material motivates and improves learning.

Zebrafish have a precocious visual system \u2013 one that provides larval fish with information to first survive and then thrive. Their visual system is thought to be ostensibly adult-like at larval ages [1], with visual experience providing little on-going instruction [2, 3]. By pooling functional imaging data from many fish we have derived the first visuo-topic sub-maps of distinct retinal inputs on to a retino-recipient brain region. In doing so, our observations collectively challenges this perception by demonstrating that the early visual maps are indeed guided by visual experience with their migration, shape and mutual alignment all being perturbed by dark-rearing. More thought provoking is our observation that some retinal inputs become less precisely ordered with on-going visual experience \u2013 providing the first experimental evidence that the optimal topographic map for efficient vision may not necessary be a highly ordered one [4]. In addition, we report a functional blindness to our moving stimuli within anterior visual fields that suggest larval fish may have a compartmentalised view of the visual world. Whether this represents a foveal like organisation or a solution to limited computational resources remains unclear. How such dedicated computational resources develop, how many exist, and how the zebrafish\u2019s behaviour accommodates and optimises them will be fascinating to explore further.", "authors": [{"uuid": "2ea6b149-7214-45e5-8de6-c588fa5ddf2c", "firstName": "Aenea", "middleName": "C", "lastName": "Hendry", "affiliations": [0, 1], "position": 0, "mail": "a.hendry@sheffield.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "e8d25995-5db6-4cc4-a686-80472e028c8c", "firstName": "Andrew", "middleName": "D", "lastName": "Bard", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "andrew.bard@kcl.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "1e8bb9ba-0cfa-4202-b2f1-7be55ee3f968", "firstName": "Gareth", "middleName": "J", "lastName": "Barker", "affiliations": [2], "position": 2, "mail": "gareth.barker@kcl.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "a6144834-f29b-4c83-9a2c-0f72013b18b8", "firstName": "Ian", "middleName": "D", "lastName": "Thompson", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "ian.thompson@kcl.ac.uk"}, {"uuid": "0d86a4ad-78a9-43b6-85e5-3e3b06be37a5", "firstName": "Andrew", "middleName": "S", "lastName": "Lowe", "affiliations": [0], "position": 4, "mail": "andrew.lowe@kcl.ac.uk"}], "sortId": 65544, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "51efb58c-4764-4061-be88-09d6dac61b4c", "country": "UK", "section": "King's College London", "address": "London", "department": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "13c50820-b319-4587-89a3-fb684a1fbefc", "country": "UK", "section": "University of Sheffield", "address": "Sheffield", "department": "Centre for Sensory Neuroscience", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "634f277a-76f0-4a64-a9df-c8f06a7011ce", "country": "UK", "section": "King's College London", "address": "London", "department": "Department of Neuroimaging", "position": 2}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/37618fde-9d69-47c9-8aab-0a3a30de675a/image", "caption": "Motion-selective Tectal Sub-maps.

Medium spiny projection neurons (MS) are the only neuron type in the striatum that project out of the structure, and they make up approximately 96% of the neurons (2). The remaining part consists of cholinergic interneurons (ChIN), fast spiking interneurons (FS) and a selection of other interneuron types. The complete synaptic connectivity of the striatal microcircuit is currently not fully established. The best available data is the statistics of pairwise connectivity.We created a subset of the striatum in silico by placing detailed reconstructed striatal neurons in a volume. The microcircuitry connectivity was inferred by detecting the spatial overlap (3) between the axonal and dendritic arbours. This resulted in a dense set of synaptic connections which were pruned by applying connectivity rules. The connections were then verified against experimental data. Detailed ion channel expressions were used to constrain the channel types used in the neuron models, and conductances were optimised with BluePyOpt (4) using electrophysiological data. The network was driven by cortical and thalamic input and simulated using Neuron on a Cray supercomputer. This demonstrates the feasibility of using sparse data to generate a detailed model of the striatum microcircuitry and to explore the effect of neuromodulators, such as dopamine and acetylcholine, on the network.", "authors": [{"uuid": "fc4462d0-1092-4fcc-b2f9-1736b3c3d230", "firstName": "Johannes", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Hjorth", "affiliations": [0, 1], "position": 0, "mail": "hjorth@kth.se"}, {"uuid": "d54d647d-787d-45a1-abd5-13aa47abfcd7", "firstName": "Alexander", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Kozlov", "affiliations": [2, 1], "position": 1, "mail": "akozlov@kth.se"}, {"uuid": "bb1f3d8f-f16d-4eb7-86e2-1481eafd2b5f", "firstName": "Johanna", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Frost Nyl\u00e9n", "affiliations": [2, 1], "position": 2, "mail": "johanna.frost.nylen@ki.se"}, {"uuid": "4c1dc55e-c444-4120-9648-730f4fb57185", "firstName": "Jeanette", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Hellgren Kotaleski", "affiliations": [2, 0, 1], "position": 3, "mail": "jeanette@csc.kth.se"}, {"uuid": "41871ccd-f034-4943-b532-b858d4ce4a75", "firstName": "Sten", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Grillner", "affiliations": [2, 1], "position": 4, "mail": "Sten.Grillner@ki.se"}], "sortId": 65546, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "5bfc4d30-3efd-4132-bf83-be3a45ec7bb8", "country": "Sweden", "section": "Royal Institute of Technology", "address": "Box 1031, 17121 Solna, Sweden", "department": "Science for Life Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Communication", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "0f022ce8-1dc6-462f-9ada-28670658688c", "country": "Sweden", "section": "Karolinska Institute", "address": "171 77 Stockholm", "department": "Stockholm Brain Institute", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "84cfc59a-42eb-4058-b22c-e77a7f0a9d5d", "country": "Sweden", "section": "Karolinska Institutet", "address": "SE-171 77 Stockholm", "department": "The Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology, Department of Neuroscience", "position": 2}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/2b8c5439-47e6-4bb4-a437-585ca393b657/image", "caption": "Illustration of the four neuron types represented in the model.

However, currently there are no common approaches to allow data to be found or made interoperable between repositories. On both CRCNS.org and the G-Node GIN data repository [2], published datasets receive persistent identifiers (DOIs) and descriptive metadata are registered that can be used to search for datasets using the DataCite [3] search facility.  We show how this metadata can be converted to a common form (RDF) that can be searched across repositories, thus achieving a first level of interoperability.  In addition to the general level of DataCite metadata, both repositories also have datasets with more detailed metadata, using the NWB:Neurophysiology format [4] or the NIX file format [5], which utilizes the odML metadata format [6].  The odML format is highly suitable for integrating metadata from heterogeneous sources because it puts no constraint on the content while providing a standardized, machine-readable representation.  We evaluated the performance of odML for metadata search and integration with document-oriented databases, which showed that indexing, searching, and versioning of extensive metadata collections is efficient using these technologies [7]. Finally, conversion of NWB and odML metadata to RDF enables linking data across repositories via the semantic web and thus offers a way to achieve interoperability between data repositories.", "authors": [{"uuid": "ed50ceb3-8e4c-4dd9-b20e-08d33daad8fa", "firstName": "Jeffrey", "middleName": "L", "lastName": "Teeters", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "jteeters@berkeley.edu"}, {"uuid": "5f3826aa-b8e6-4073-a762-92e68e19ea4d", "firstName": "Petr", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Je\u017eek", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "jezekp@kiv.zcu.cz"}, {"uuid": "70a92210-7f93-43df-a35b-79e1923bdfb2", "firstName": "Christian", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Garbers", "affiliations": [2], "position": 2, "mail": "garbers@biologie.uni-muenchen.de"}, {"uuid": "2c32d73a-1b37-4d50-93a4-8a4668a953b0", "firstName": "Christian", "middleName": "J", "lastName": "Kellner", "affiliations": [2], "position": 3, "mail": "kellner@biologie.uni-muenchen.de"}, {"uuid": "bbf9b3e3-2b28-4254-9951-f54a72ac9b9a", "firstName": "Michael", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Sonntag", "affiliations": [2], "position": 4, "mail": "sonntag@biologie.uni-muenchen.de"}, {"uuid": "e7278f77-cd52-4aab-80bd-74eb2e0ebe1e", "firstName": "Achilleas", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Koutsou", "affiliations": [2], "position": 5, "mail": "koutsou@biologie.uni-muenchen.de"}, {"uuid": "9adc4d75-761a-40d4-ae4a-72d9b35b16cd", "firstName": "Jan", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Grewe", "affiliations": [3], "position": 6, "mail": "jan.grewe@uni-tuebingen.de"}, {"uuid": "bef15e66-7964-4975-9b55-2778e23ad268", "firstName": "Friedrich", "middleName": "T", "lastName": "Sommer", "affiliations": [0], "position": 7, "mail": "fsommer@berkeley.edu"}, {"uuid": "afa13fbf-2e0e-4c36-8404-83ce3ae1b322", "firstName": "Thomas", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Wachtler", "affiliations": [2], "position": 8, "mail": "wachtler@bio.lmu.de"}], "sortId": 65547, "topic": " Electrophysiology", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "eff29a37-d2ac-4015-bee5-3de573998c23", "country": "USA", "section": "UC Berkeley", "address": null, "department": "Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "71cc7f7e-7d08-4f7e-825e-f6defc053845", "country": "Czechia", "section": "University of West Bohemia", "address": null, "department": null, "position": 1}, {"uuid": "80d1f006-66d7-46f0-af12-54dda23f5364", "country": "Germany", "section": "Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "address": "Martinsried", "department": "German Neuroinformatics Node", "position": 2}, {"uuid": "493013a6-456f-47fa-93a8-24b0a35e29c0", "country": "Germany", "section": "Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen", "address": "T\u00fcbingen", "department": "Institute for Neurobiology", "position": 3}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:27.703Z", "references": [{"text": "The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship", "doi": "10.1038/sdata.2016.18", "link": null, "uuid": "82362e5d-2001-4df4-8d09-87d47e3feb85"}, {"text": "https://gin.g-node.org", "doi": null, "link": "https://gin.g-node.org", "uuid": "33121a31-8903-4b22-b83c-c3edf3bf32e0"}, {"text": "http://datacite.org", "doi": null, "link": "http://datacite.org", "uuid": "2c61da5f-3cde-4450-ad46-2ab82e6493ac"}, {"text": "Neurodata Without Borders: Creating a Common Data Format for Neurophysiology", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuron.2015.10.025", "link": null, "uuid": "b25057bf-1b3d-4ed3-85e8-c35409739616"}, {"text": "http://www.g-node.org/nix", "doi": null, "link": "http://www.g-node.org/nix", "uuid": "c7ef37fd-7d6e-4194-8543-26c37a769dff"}, {"text": "http://www.g-node.org/projects/odml", "doi": null, "link": "http://www.g-node.org/projects/odml", "uuid": "119be3b5-7e96-46ba-8328-5b6ef185f614"}, {"text": "Neuronal data storage using document oriented databases", "doi": "10.3389/conf.fncom.2012.55.00264", "link": null, "uuid": "2493c5d6-1108-424c-b4ee-c7560d57254e"}], "acknowledgements": "NSF grant 1516527, BMBF grants 01GQ1302 and 01GQ1509.", "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/6ef064a1-9bf5-4fe3-842e-81a186988dc3/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0018", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "6ef064a1-9bf5-4fe3-842e-81a186988dc3", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/6ef064a1-9bf5-4fe3-842e-81a186988dc3/stateLog", "title": "Parallel Model Optimization against Experimental Data with NeuronUnit", "text": "Scientific insight is well-served by the discovery and optimization of abstract models that can reproduce experimental findings. NeuroML (NeuroML.org), a model description language for neuroscience, facilitates reproducibility and exchange of such models by providing an implementation-agnostic model description in a modular format. NeuronUnit (neuronunit.scidash.org) evaluates model accuracy by subjecting models to experimental data-driven validation tests, a formalization of the scientific method. In order to scale such tests to a wide variety of biological neuron types and a range of model classes, computationally efficient techniques for test-driven model optimization are needed.  Here we use parallel genetic algorithms to efficiently sample a large model parameter space in the context of NeuronUnit testing of NeuroML models. This is accomplished using the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python (DEAP) library.  We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach for a variety of model types, testing against experimental data from both NeuroElectro.org and the Allen Institute Cell Types database. For each model class and biological neuron type, we obtained an error surface via a Non-Dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm (NSGA), corresponding to plausible subsets of candidate parameter values that respect intrinsic biological diversity. \n", "authors": [{"uuid": "4862f1d8-c51c-411d-80d2-51e0c9dae2ca", "firstName": "Russell", "middleName": "Jarrod", "lastName": "Jarvis", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "rjjarvis@asu.edu"}, {"uuid": "c4141e3e-8978-4a59-9008-e6accae668bb", "firstName": "Richard", "middleName": "C", "lastName": "Gerkin", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "Rick Gerkin <rgerkin@asu.edu>"}, {"uuid": "aee35031-f848-4f68-bb0d-c0f169e025e7", "firstName": "Sharon", "middleName": "M", "lastName": "Crook", "affiliations": [0, 1], "position": 2, "mail": "Sharon.Crook@asu.edu"}], "sortId": 65548, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "60b30095-0915-4722-9f65-716769acbd41", "country": "USA", "section": "Arizona State University", "address": "Tempe, AZ 85287", "department": "School of Life Sciences", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "a8f4e601-cf09-4828-ba3a-ab57e86ee686", "country": "USA", "section": "Arizona State University", "address": "Tempe, AZ 85287 ", "department": "School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences", "position": 1}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:27.910Z", "references": [{"text": "Gleeson, Padraig, et al. \"NeuroML: a language for describing data driven models of neurons and networks with a high degree of biological detail.\" PLoS Comput Biol 6.6 (2010): e1000815.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815", "link": "http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815", "uuid": "83f19928-670d-429c-93bd-b0c3405ad14c"}, {"text": "Tripathy, Shreejoy J., et al. \"NeuroElectro: a window to the world\u2019s neuron electrophysiology data.\" Frontiers in Neuroinformatics (2015): 146.", "doi": "10.3389/fninf.2014.00040", "link": "http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2014.00040/full", "uuid": "53f2ee57-6f4d-4ec2-bda0-7a7f7afddaf9"}, {"text": "Sarma, Gopal P., et al. \"Unit testing, model validation, and biological simulation.\" F1000Research 5 (2016).", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.9315.1", "link": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5007758/", "uuid": "83068b36-c2f7-4b40-9d3b-9343a92d77ec"}], "acknowledgements": "This work was supported in part by grant R01EB021711 from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and by grant R01MH106674 from the National Institute of Mental Health.", "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/5cac8611-f2f0-4da9-9b5a-1e20402c0c39/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0019", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "5cac8611-f2f0-4da9-9b5a-1e20402c0c39", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/5cac8611-f2f0-4da9-9b5a-1e20402c0c39/stateLog", "title": "Transcriptomic patterns underlying neuron electrophysiological diversity identified through large-scale mega-analysis", "text": "How neuronal diversity emerges from complex patterns of gene expression remains poorly understood. We present an approach to understand electrophysiological diversity through gene expression by integrating pooled- and single-cell transcriptomics with intracellular electrophysiology. \n\nWe constructed a novel dataset on brain-wide neuronal gene expression and electrophysiological diversity by using cell type ontologies to integrate the NeuroElectro and NeuroExpresso databases. We performed a mega-analysis on this literature-based dataset, asking if there were individual genes whose expression was correlated with electrophysiological diversity across the collection of 34 neuron types. We identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 electrophysiological parameters. The majority of these correlations validated in an independent dataset on visual cortex cellular diversity collected by the Allen Institute. \n\nMany associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like GABRD and SCN1A (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms.

We use \u201cexpected mutual information\u201d (EMI) [3] to weigh the closeness of the relation between a pair of resources and for each, plot its top 20 co-mention partners, ranked by EMI [4] (Fig 1a), available through web service [4]. The co-mention partner graph shows the relative influence of a resource and provides implicit yet rich and accurate assessment of its value. We then use the smart local moving (SLM) algorithm [5] to detect resource communities from the entire network of resource co-mention. We evaluate the quality of the detected communities by \u201cnormalized coherence score,\u201d which subtracts the count of inter-community co-mentions from that of intra-community co-mentions, and divides the difference by their diameter (i.e., the maximum length of the shortest paths) of the largest community to normalize community size granularity.

Image quality depends on diffraction at the pupil and aberrations in the cornea and lens. Chromatic aberration occurs owing to light dispersion. Cones show maximal light sensitivity to either the long (L), medium (M), or short (S) wavelength, which mediates color vision. Cones form a distinctive spatial arrangement, the cone mosaic. S-cones show nonrandom distribution. Since the retina receives light that has passed through the eye optics, they are important in visual information processing.\n In order to elucidate the influence of the optical characteristics on our vision, we developed a computational model of the cone mosaic with eye optics. The model incorporated the spectral sensitivities of the cones as well as their nonuniform spatial distributions. The cone response to chromatic light was modeled by spectral sensitivity and the equations of the membrane dynamics. The optical model was composed of the cornea and lens. By convoluting the image with the polychromatic point-spread function (PSF), we were able to calculate a retinal image with aberrations. The PSF was obtained by the pupil function as shown in Figure 1.\n In the simulation, it was demonstrated that the S-cones respond to wider spatial images than the L- and M-cones, as short wavelength light is blurred by chromatic aberration. The simulation results are consistent with the empirical observation concerning sparse S-cone sampling.", "authors": [{"uuid": "8096f0ce-ba3a-43df-8c04-7164c54afa1c", "firstName": "Mio", "middleName": null, "lastName": "KUMAGAI", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "im173002@cis.aichi-pu.ac.jp"}, {"uuid": "f5882c6c-2583-4508-ae3b-ed72857e7f02", "firstName": "Yoshimi", "middleName": null, "lastName": "KAMIYAMA", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "kamiyama@ist.aichi-pu.ac.jp"}], "sortId": 65552, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "a312ea1a-1269-49c9-944a-32832ae59b44", "country": "Japan", "section": "Aichi Prefectural University", "address": "1522-3 Ibaragabasama, Nagakute, Aichi", "department": "Information Science and Technology", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/029b0fad-8bf7-4929-9ff4-d0487938f301/image", "caption": "A model of the cone mosaic with eye optics.

While we need human readability, we also need machine readable content in order to represent the knowledge in a publication (Kennedy, 2016). We are interested in a complete markup of the data-to-observation process contained within the publication.\n\nMethods\nThe first task is to develop an annotation schema that encompasses the complete raw data - to - result process. Given a Publication Schema, we then need to implement this within a Publication Markup Tool which can be applied to a publication \u2018as is\u2019. We have created a prototype of a Publication Markup Tool using Hypothes.is (Udell, 2015). See Figure 1 for example.\n\nResults\nThe publication text supporting any Schema entity is selected for annotation and tagged using a Keyword. For each schema tag, the user completes a set of qualifiers that are appropriate for that tag. Final annotated publications are validated and viewed at the publication portal (http://pub.virtualbrain.org/pm/18003631).\n\nConclusions\nWe have successfully developed the necessary schema and Publication Markup Tool Prototype. Testing is ongoing to improve performance and develop an initial corpus of annotated neuroanatomic volumetric literature. The general technology used herein is applicable to many other diverse applications.", "authors": [{"uuid": "bb57281a-8c52-48b9-935f-6d5c12d9ef61", "firstName": "David", "middleName": "N.", "lastName": "Kennedy", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "David.Kennedy@umassmed.edu"}, {"uuid": "d6b59fed-cfb9-4101-83f3-7f8f99663e6c", "firstName": "Jon ", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Udell", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "judell@hypothes.is"}, {"uuid": "2ce94b59-3157-46d4-88bb-f7de0ce89bb0", "firstName": "Christian", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Haselgrove", "affiliations": [0], "position": 2, "mail": "Christian.Haselgrove@umassmed.edu"}, {"uuid": "85bb6d1c-ef62-4135-be0f-c774c8d077db", "firstName": "Steven", "middleName": "M.", "lastName": "Hodge", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "Steven.Hodge@umassmed.edu"}, {"uuid": "4a40e33f-ec6f-41c6-a23e-66ab52e3673a", "firstName": "Leah", "middleName": "B.", "lastName": "Honor", "affiliations": [2], "position": 4, "mail": "Leah.Honor@umassmed.edu"}, {"uuid": "40b7a483-0dae-4eca-b1c0-343124b3c10d", "firstName": "Jean", "middleName": "A.

Reg-MaxS applies a sequence of translation, rotation and scaling transformations, estimating at each step the transformation parameters that maximize spatial overlap between the neurites of the morphologies. We test this algorithm  using synthetically transformed morphologies, showing that it can account for a wide range of transformation differences and is robust to small perturbations of dendritic positions. Using Reg-MaxS, the algorithm Reg-MaxS-N co-registers groups of more than two morphologies by iteratively calculating an average morphology and registering all morphologies to this average. We test Reg-MaxS-N using three sets of morphologies from the Drosophila brain with different sizes and branching patterns, showing that it outperforms a PCA-based method and produces registrations very similar to those obtained by using a standard brain atlas.

Previously, we have developed text mining to obtain co-mention data [2]  from research literature as well as a curation tool using Hypothes.is Web annotation platform [3] to validate text mining output. The procedure records the resources mentioned from 246,498 papers and stores each paper-resource pair in a database. We apply the frequent itemset mining algorithm [4,5,6] on this co-mention data to generate association rules. For example, association rule \u201cif (A & B) then C with confidence 0.7\u201d states that resource C is mentioned in 70% of the papers where resources A and B are mentioned together. To generate recommendations, we keep track of the resource pages the end user visits. At every page request, we consider all the association rules whose left hand side resources (i.e., A & B) are a subset of the visited set and recommend all the resources on the right hand side (i.e., C) that haven\u2019t yet been visited.

Here we combined the high spatial resolution of fMRI with the high temporal resolution of EEG constructing a unique general linear model (GLM) to investigate how fMRI identified brain regions contribute to event-related potential (ERP) signatures of target-processing[3,4]. The synchronous signals are recorded from fourteen subjects who stimulated by the rare tones or novel sounds which were served as targets in different blocks. The results indicated that target-related fMRI activation on the frontoparietal regions as well as bilateral caudate nucleus and cerebellum which was most regions identified by target-related ERP signatures.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are complementary neuroimaging modalities in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. To get higher spatiotemporal resolution at the same time, simultaneous EEG-fMRI can provide solution to this limitation. EEG signals are able to capture the neural activity inside the brain from the scalp with higher temporal resolution and fMRI records the hemodynamic response which is the delayed response with respect to neural activity with higher spatial resolution. There is common association between these two modalities with respect to any neural activity occurring in the brain. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI provide us the high spatial and high temporal resolution at the same time which is desirable. However, recorded EEG data give the information in temporal domain as one dimensional signal; whereas, fMRI data is in spatial domain in terms of 2D or 3D images. Data fusion approach can be used to combine the two data sets.In this work, data fusion approach is applied on the acquired simultaneous EEG-fMRI data and brain activation patterns are generated which provide more information about the brain. Therefore, Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data can help researchers as well as clinicians to provide more detailed information about the cognitive functions of the brain.

The functional network analysis was implemented on multi-electrode array (MEA) signals recorded from hippocampal regions in isoflurane-anaesthetized Lister-hooded rats before and after local unilateral kainic acid (KA)-induced epileptiform activity (Senik et. al., 2013). Color-coded graphic of conditional modularity measure for 19 MEA nodes separated into four subregions was constructed to show community detection on the conditional network. Comparison of four different stages shows the effect of KA on neuronal interactions within and across the different subregions. The effect of KA can be seen by the appearance of extra modules after injection of KA at 30 minutes into the experiment. All subregions have specific nodes for within- and across-subregion connectivities. The results indicate that conditional modularity analysis can be used to classify the inter- and intra-modular nodes. Classification of the nodes into different hippocampal subregions presents further information about functional connectivities within and across subregions.", "authors": [{"uuid": "21c913a1-9e73-44d9-8047-c6ced49384a7", "firstName": "Siti ", "middleName": "Noormiza", "lastName": "Makhtar", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "noormiza@upnm.edu.my"}, {"uuid": "bb0d99f2-b021-49d5-abba-0d5fe4e8f5c8", "firstName": "David", "middleName": "M", "lastName": "Halliday", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "david.halliday"}, {"uuid": "b032e3ed-30e1-4bdc-a314-1fa29bc70a3c", "firstName": "Mohd", "middleName": "Harizal", "lastName": "Senik", "affiliations": [2], "position": 2, "mail": "mohdharizalsenik@gmail.com"}], "sortId": 65558, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "907bd0c7-56f5-4293-b8e0-b62d982675db", "country": "Malaysia", "section": "Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia", "address": "Kuala Lumpur", "department": "Dept of Electrical and Electronics ", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "6b626def-733d-4a4e-a6fb-b33458523c04", "country": "United Kingdom", "section": "University of York", "address": "York", "department": "Dept of Electronic Engineering", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "39faaf5c-429d-4c34-bfa3-0d6d68c99e14", "country": "Malaysia", "section": "Universiti Sains Malaysia", "address": "Kelantan", "department": "Dept of Neurosciences, School of Medical Sciences", "position": 2}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/19769b65-b848-4821-a07e-d3eae1a51530/image", "caption": "Conditional modularity measure for 19 MEA nodes separated into 4 subregions, CA1R, CA3R,CA1L and CA3L.

To investigate the underlying histological profile of recorded neurons, we present a novel method for identifying those cells post-hoc in fixed brain sections. We reconstruct a 3D histological model and extract a projection of blood vessels. In the images of the one-photon epifluorescence microscope, we detect blood vessels by using an intravenously injected fluorescent dye. Based on multimodally acquired structures of blood vessels we register the images of the one-photon epifluorescence microscope and the histological model. The imaging modalities show a divergence of the perspective, which we compensate for by using a simulation based approach. We use a feature-based approach for identifying in vivo recorded cells in the histological model. The features include information of the cells position, shape, and the profile of the apical dendrite. By using this novel method of identifying in vivo recorded cells in an immunohistochemical 3D model, we expect to gain novel insights into how distinct types of neuron and neuronal assemblies contribute to decision making in rat\u2019s prefrontal cortex.

Methods:40 right-handed subjects (20 males; age 23.2\u00b11.9 yrs) underwent 3T MRI (32-channel head coil) scans of pre-task resting-state, visual working memory task, and a post-task resting-state.

Recent studies suggested that activation in the resting state networks (RSNs) could be a potential index for functional characterization of cognitive impairments [2]. While those studies focused on the effects of long-term PE on RSNs, we investigated the relationship among the duration of participation in community based physical exercise clubs (PECs), activations detected in RSNs and the scores representing physical activity (PA). Methods:75 healthy older adults (age 61-78, 45 females) participated in this study. Their PEC histories including PA score (measured by IPAQ-A & E) were obtained via an interview. Participants received a resting-state (eyes open) session in a 3T scanner. Results: Negative effects of PEC history and PA on RSN were detected in the VSN and ACG of the anterior SN (Fig1). Activation in ACG was also negatively correlated with IPAQ-A and E. The activation in the SN is augmented as age increased [3], suggesting higher demand for integrating perception of external environment with internal sensory information as we age. The observed decreased activation in ACG with longer participation in PECs as well as higher PA was consistent with previous findings [4].

The pyloric rhythm in the crab Cancer borealis is disrupted after blocking descending neuromodulators, a process called deafferentation, but can recover 3-4 days later1. This rhythm recovery is regulated by homeostatic plasticity, and recent studies suggest it is related to changes in the linear ratios of ion channel densities, i.e. ion channel correlations (ICCs), which are difficult to measure simultaneously in experiments. \n\tTo systematically identify ICCs, we first combined a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called NSGA II with a biophysical model of the pyloric circuit to generate 1008 models whose outputs resemble the observed rhythms both before and 4 days after deafferentation2-5. Each model contains 34 variables and each variable is the maximum conductance of an ionic current. We then applied Pearson\u2019s correlation to quantify the ICCs between the variables and identified 17 pairs of ICCs with |r| >= 0.8 at control but none at 4 days after deafferentation, which in general match experiment results6.\n\tThe ensemble modeling approach above enables a systematic examination of ICCs at the circuit level. We can further apply network analysis to detect clusters among the 34 parameters and to visualize cluster shifts during the recovery7.", "authors": [{"uuid": "b260deb8-f9dc-4163-922e-2fe8af8a9ec3", "firstName": "Kun", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Tian", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "io.kuntian@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "1e095ea6-61a6-4317-a7f5-091717b100f8", "firstName": "Astrid", "middleName": "A", "lastName": "Prinz", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "astrid.prinz@emory.edu"}], "sortId": 65564, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "8b86556e-3c71-442d-b681-d057771b2d5e", "country": "U.S.", "section": "Emory University", "address": "Atlanta", "department": "Biology", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:31.214Z", "references": [{"text": "Luther, J.

For the mesoscopic scale, tracer injection experiments are being carried out to precisely determine the connectivity patterns of the brain.   \n\nWe present a data processing pipeline for carrying out tracer injection based connectomics, running on a high-performance cluster (HPC) at the Neuroinformatics Japan Center (NIJC).  The data processing pipeline carries out the computational processing in a distributed manner and provides flow control for the workflow.\n\nFor this work a brain is injected with an anterograde viral tracer. Then the brain is sectioned, and fluorescent images acquired using a slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0 HT, Hamamatsu). Through computational processing a 3D brain reconstruction is created that is then registered to a common reference space with a brain atlas - see Figure 1. Tracer signal segmentation was done using Gaussian mixture unsupervised learning trained on a set of tracer image subregions. Based on the tracer segmentation and reference atlas we can calculate the projections of neurons at the injection site. Ex-vivo MRI T2 and DWI from the 9.4 Tesla MRI scanner at RIKEN was also collected to allow for comparisons  between tracer and DWI derived data. Data from more experiments are being integrated, where eventually a complete connectome will be formed and results will be shared on the Brain/MINDS Data Portal [2].

While reduced grey matter volume (GMV) associated with general cognitive decline has been consistently reported in aging [3,4] , it is less understood if age-related changes in GMV will show similar effects of reduced hemispheric asymmetry. The current study aims to investigate age-related changes in GMV and its association to language and visuospatial processing. Methods: 21 young (age=22.76\u00b14.43, MMSE=29.52\u00b1.60) and 17 older Japanese adults (age=67.24\u00b11.05, MMSE=28.88\u00b1 1.05) performed a line judgment task (LJ) and a homophone judgment task (HJ) in a 3T MRI scanner. VBM[5] with DARTEL in SPM8 was applied to high resolution T1-weighted images. Results: Fig1b shows the behavioral findings. Multiple regression with age, gender and total intracranical volume (TIV) as covariates are shown in Fig1c. Extracted ROIs for both tasks showed significant correlations in Fig1d. Conclusion: Greater GMV in right BA39 and right IPL was associated with slower performance in LJ, verifying a local regional effect on speed of processing in visuospatial processes. Interestingly, greater GMV in right BA45 and IFG, instead of left was associated with higher accuracy on the HJ task. Our results of asymmetric associations highlight differential age-related effects of GMV reduction.", "authors": [{"uuid": "26de4c68-83e5-4a36-aefc-57be00910c82", "firstName": "Gladys", "middleName": "Jiamin", "lastName": "Heng", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "JHENG007@e.ntu.edu.sg"}, {"uuid": "fe6e3833-b71c-4b4e-8846-7a16bce53337", "firstName": "Suren", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Gan", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "srgan@ntu.edu.sg"}, {"uuid": "6e54255c-4293-4e30-b53a-5cd9d5db894c", "firstName": "Toshiharu", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Nakai", "affiliations": [1], "position": 2, "mail": "toshi@ncgg.go.jp"}, {"uuid": "b591d4db-0065-4b02-8b43-cb75ac260c1d", "firstName": "SH", "middleName": "Annabel", "lastName": "Chen", "affiliations": [2, 0, 3], "position": 3, "mail": "annabelchen@ntu.edu.sg"}], "sortId": 65567, "topic": " Normal development / cognition", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "60f49314-640d-4d8d-a01c-4563368629fd", "country": "Singapore", "section": "Nanyang Technological University", "address": "14 Nanyang Drive", "department": "Psychology", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "ba5e253b-aa5f-40d7-a3ee-91bb613b10b7", "country": "Japan", "section": "National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology", "address": " Ohbu, Aichi, 474-8511", "department": "Neuroimaging & Informatics", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "a54a1680-5041-4f68-aa46-ac2b260c0f05", "country": "Singapore", "section": "Nanyang Technological University", "address": null, "department": "Centre for Research and Development in Learning", "position": 2}, {"uuid": "f37e93fc-8311-4dc2-86e1-e93d3dd9a086", "country": "Singapore", "section": "Nanyang Technological University", "address": null, "department": "LKCMedicine", "position": 3}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/9b77c5d8-c933-4820-9c5c-d9ac3583278f/image", "caption": "Tasks and Results", "uuid": "9b77c5d8-c933-4820-9c5c-d9ac3583278f", "position": 1}], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:31.832Z", "references": [{"text": "Cabeza, R.

In this study, we employed feature selection methods to identify discriminant functional connections that represent differential characteristics between schizophrenia group and healthy group. Those selected features were then fed to a classifier for schizophrenia recognition. All possible combinations of three feature selection methods (i.e., t-test, Kendall Tau, and Fisher\u2019s score) and three classifiers (i.e., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis) were applied to a resting-state fMRI dataset of 140 subjects. The best classification performance (i.e., 87.86%) was achieved by the combination of Fisher\u2019s score and linear support vector machine using 310 selected features of functional connections. Almost all selected functional connections exhibited fairly weaker strength in the linkages between brain regions for patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found a distributed inter-hemispheric connectivity reduction in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. \n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that feature selection and classification method can be used to identify aberrant functional connections in schizophrenia, and is helpful for the investigation of schizophrenia. \n", "authors": [{"uuid": "227aea08-c9ce-41b9-a1bd-1834c38217bb", "firstName": "Junhua", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Li", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "juhalee.bcmi@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "08d8153e-9633-4643-a21b-dec933c63b0d", "firstName": "Yu", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Sun", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "kissalladin@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "e6ab32f8-e9f1-484e-84b7-85f25720449f", "firstName": "Rongjun", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Yu", "affiliations": [1], "position": 2, "mail": "psyyr@nus.edu.sg"}, {"uuid": "4bdbf2af-0895-409b-9bb5-2981700d2f7f", "firstName": "Nitish", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Thakor", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "sinapsedirector@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "51999840-3d44-48e4-b0d6-22260b52b357", "firstName": "Anastasios", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Bezerianos", "affiliations": [0], "position": 4, "mail": "anastasios.bezerianos@gmail.com"}], "sortId": 65568, "topic": "Computational neuroscience", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "09ceb7e9-27b7-46bf-99ca-34e714a2eb19", "country": "Singapore", "section": "National University of Singapore", "address": "28 medical drive", "department": "Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE)", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "a7812339-8c05-42d5-967c-95b49d61bdce", "country": "Singapore", "section": "National University of Singapore", "address": null, "department": "Department of Psychology", "position": 1}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:32.037Z", "references": [{"text": "Mar\u00edn, O., 2012.

Here, we show that when given a choice between two alternative samples of cabbage to ingest, captive born orangutans (n = 6) voluntarily chose the sample that contained greater amounts of anthocyanin. This occurred when they had to decide between samples of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. rubra) from the same plant (p<0.05), and samples from green cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) (p<0.01), indicating that anthocyanin holds a reward value for these hominids. There was no difference in L*a*b* colour between ingested and discarded samples in red cabbage, but when the choice was between two green samples, the animals chose samples that were more green and yellow. There was also no difference in the amount of lightness (L*) between chosen and discarded samples of either plant.

In many animals including Drosophila, electric shock has been proven to be a potent noxious stimulus. The behavioral response of flies to electric shock is diverse, ranging from numb, locomotion increase, escape jump, and falling. As the shock is an 'emergency', the priority of responses is on speed rather than precision. Video recording and computer-based detection of the shock responses are therefore demanding. Here we improve TPro, software to detect and track multiple flies for accommodating precise detection of shock responses. Difficulty in determining head orientation due to fast changes in body axes upon shock application particularly impairs  precision in tracking. We show that application of image-based CNN precisely determines head orientation even in difficult situations, such as during scramble jump. These new implementations in TPro greatly improved precision in fly detection, and are thereby expected to contribute to following tracking and further behavioral classification.", "authors": [{"uuid": "fa1347bd-bd2b-4501-839e-193074610e3c", "firstName": "Takuto", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Okuno", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "okuno.takuto.t5@dc.tohoku.ac.jp"}, {"uuid": "582314ab-6e41-4ed7-86cd-5b36f9745129", "firstName": "Masayoshi ", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Ikarashi", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "masayoshi.ikarashi.s8@dc.tohoku.ac.jp"}, {"uuid": "ada0f4fa-4856-46a8-a156-92ae16d0ed6d", "firstName": "Pudith", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Sirigrivatanawong", "affiliations": [1], "position": 2, "mail": "pudith@ic.is.tohoku.ac.jp"}, {"uuid": "03961e0b-f9cb-49b4-a4ab-b508ef9945b9", "firstName": "Koichi", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Hashimoto", "affiliations": [1], "position": 3, "mail": "koichi@m.tohoku.ac.jp"}, {"uuid": "05ef1e48-62cf-44b3-ab72-f623b1bc848e", "firstName": "Hiromu", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Tanimoto", "affiliations": [0], "position": 4, "mail": "hiromu.tanimoto.d3@tohoku.ac.jp"}], "sortId": 65571, "topic": " Normal development / cognition", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "45730b3f-7009-4022-bace-f7fdc1c1a0ec", "country": "Japan", "section": "Tohoku University", "address": "Katahira2-1-1, Aoba-Ku, Sendai 980-8577", "department": " Graduate School of Life Sciences", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "d92ef1a2-8c75-42ce-89ba-53c2057baf7a", "country": "Japan", "section": "Tohoku University", "address": "Aoba6-6-01, Aramaki-Aza, Aoba-Ku, Sendai 980-8579", "department": "Graduate School of Information Sciences", "position": 1}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:32.660Z", "references": [], "acknowledgements": null, "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/7df6fa13-4325-427d-84c5-0c6606b5cfb4/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0042", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "7df6fa13-4325-427d-84c5-0c6606b5cfb4", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/7df6fa13-4325-427d-84c5-0c6606b5cfb4/stateLog", "title": "NeuroLex, InterLex, and the NIF Standard Ontology", "text": "Shared terminology is one of the foundations of modern science.

We are curating the community contributed information contained in NeuroLex and integrating it into the NIF ontology using the new functionality provided by InterLex. Using git and InterLex we have updated and streamlined the process by which community contributions are reviewed and incorporated into the formal NIF ontology. Here we will present a detailed overview of the new architecture for the community and formal ontologies, as well as details on how to contribute to and make use of them.", "authors": [{"uuid": "10d7307e-a5ac-4cd9-9452-2205feb0902d", "firstName": "Tom", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Gillespie", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "tgillesp@ucsd.edu"}, {"uuid": "feca5c43-4524-4ca7-b4dc-d9092f573bbe", "firstName": "Fariba", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Fana", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "fariba@eng.ucsd.edu"}, {"uuid": "9c2e782f-3a65-4703-9334-919b0e4b7f99", "firstName": "Jeffrey", "middleName": "S", "lastName": "Grethe", "affiliations": [2], "position": 2, "mail": "jgrethe@ucsd.edu"}, {"uuid": "23d97b18-6ef3-49b6-9e23-9903aca6f9c8", "firstName": "Anita", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Bandrowski", "affiliations": [2], "position": 3, "mail": "abandrowski@ucsd.edu"}, {"uuid": "3e6dea71-36e8-4d7d-9661-a2618d9c2549", "firstName": "Maryann", "middleName": "E", "lastName": "Martone", "affiliations": [3], "position": 4, "mail": "mmartone@ucsd.edu"}], "sortId": 65572, "topic": "General neuroinformatics", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "bc608a51-ed3d-413c-979d-5ec7755d553a", "country": "USA", "section": "UC San Diego", "address": "CA", "department": "Neurosciences Graduate Program", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "8bcbe21b-6853-4148-a365-1ce0b5fc7fdd", "country": "USA", "section": "UC San Diego", "address": "CA", "department": "Department of Engineering", "position": 1}, {"uuid": "6a7da2f9-3ecb-47d4-a017-a6cbab1f6558", "country": "USA", "section": "UC San Diego", "address": "CA", "department": "Center for Research in Biological Systems", "position": 2}, {"uuid": "822d86a6-09c3-4286-a333-26b9339a7320", "country": "USA", "section": "UC San Diego", "address": "CA", "department": "Department of Neurosciences", "position": 3}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:32.862Z", "references": [], "acknowledgements": "This work has been supported by NIH Grant 1U24DA039832-01.", "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/c107e8f7-1699-4032-918d-bcdf331ee3b0/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0043", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "c107e8f7-1699-4032-918d-bcdf331ee3b0", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/c107e8f7-1699-4032-918d-bcdf331ee3b0/stateLog", "title": " Visualization of the connectivity of basal ganglia nuclei using MRtrix3", "text": "MRtrix3 is an Advanced tools for the analysis of diffusion MRI data.

As more research projects confront Big Data, it becomes important to streamline parallel and distributed computing, to easily allow large data processing across multiple compute cores (CPU and/or GPU) and nodes, respectively. Ideally, the analysis code suited for exploratory analysis of small portions or subsamples of the full dataset could be used identically, or with minimal modifications, when scaling up to the full analysis on a large node, computer cluster, grid, or cloud resource. This would include high-level constructs both for parallelizing code and for representing data too large to fit in the memory of a single machine or even all available machines.

More than half of the world\u2019s population is bilingual(BL). The study aims to examine the BL advantage & understand the neural correlate underlying this value by using electroencephalography as the modality & visualising the functional connectivity patterns in bilinguals & monolinguals(ML).\nThe study engaged the use of 10 BL & 10 ML, normal adults. The Simon task involves interference in the response-selection stage hence it was chosen as the stimuli to understand the BL advantage. The brain activity during task was measured using EEG.\nML showed higher connectivity in frontoplanar regions (BA 10, involved in decision making, working memory) in alpha, beta & gamma bands. This may be due to an increased recruitment of the electrodes in ML causing interference leading to a drop in their accuracy. Whereas the increased frontoplanar connectivity in BL in theta band suggests that theta synchronization was high causing an efficient task performance when compared to ML.\nIn conclusion, BL advantage suppresses interference rather than inhibiting response & this interference control task consumes more mental effort in the ML. BL brain deals with the interference by utilizing few task-specific resources as observed in the few connections involving areas related to visuospatial processing, whereas the performance of ML depends on numerous functional connectivities between areas reflecting executive processing.\n", "authors": [{"uuid": "0cf82209-65d0-4be9-ba5c-e55570c4814c", "firstName": "Rosheema Bala", "middleName": null, "lastName": "J.B.", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "rosheema@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "9bbed7a8-233d-4afa-9986-829df759f461", "firstName": "Monica", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Ashokumar", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "monicaashokumar@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "1ca3a283-e79b-49a8-be10-31a3b60c36ec", "firstName": "Geethanjali", "middleName": null, "lastName": "B.", "affiliations": [0], "position": 2, "mail": "geethanjalib@ssn.edu.in"}, {"uuid": "ec9da54a-bf6c-485a-9d99-75495bd51388", "firstName": "Mahesh", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Veezhinathan", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "maheshv@gmail.com"}], "sortId": 65575, "topic": " Visualization", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "ebf3530a-8d32-40ed-b5f8-572886118ef3", "country": "India", "section": "SSN College of Engineering", "address": "Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Kalavakkam, Chennai", "department": "Biomedical Engineering", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/d5bd41d4-51b1-40fa-b2cb-8be01ded3a24/image", "caption": "Visualization", "uuid": "d5bd41d4-51b1-40fa-b2cb-8be01ded3a24", "position": 1}], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:33.461Z", "references": [{"text": "Appelblad, E., & Sandz\u00e9n, O.

Here, we constructed time-evolving pain-related brain networks using the information from the biomedical literature of Pubmed database, considering the advances and changes in pain research over the last few decades. We retrieved 141,552 abstracts and publication dates of pain-related articles using Biopython Entrez API (Pubmed query: \u2018Pain[majr]\u2019, 2017.05.28.) In order to define nodes for the network construction, we got 594 brain regions as candidates after curating the brain area lists downloaded from Brede database. The occurrence frequency of each brain region in the retrieved abstracts were counted and areas with more than 10 were selected for the network construction. Edges were defined as the co-occurrence between two brain areas in abstracts. The established time-evolving pain-related brain networks showed remarkable changes in our understanding of the pain-related network over the few decades and provided the insights for the future research direction about the brain mechanism of pain.", "authors": [{"uuid": "c50e4102-ce14-4753-a8c1-b9b2586c2bc1", "firstName": "Jihong", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Oh", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "jihong421@hanmail.net"}, {"uuid": "0fa8ed50-9165-4801-be9e-72fdd33d4f72", "firstName": "Chang-Eop", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Kim", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "eopchang@gachon.ac.kr"}], "sortId": 65578, "topic": "General neuroinformatics", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "579d19dd-dbdc-4865-aeca-02510f92fcc0", "country": "Republic of Korea", "section": "Gachon University", "address": "Seongnam 13120", "department": "College of Korean Medicine", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 1, "short": "P", "uuid": "41d42264-bcb8-4dcd-aabc-eecda6ca394c", "name": "Poster"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:34.070Z", "references": [{"text": "Nielsen, F. \u00c5.

Journals participating in the initiative ask authors to retrieve a unique identifier, an RRID, for each resource in the methods section of their paper.\nSince 2014, RRIDs appear in over 250 journals, and over 3000 papers where curators have confirmed that the authors used an RRID for one or more resources. Cell press, eLife and the Endocrinology Society have signed on in 2016.\nPapers containing RRIDs are found by curators and articles are then processed using scibot https://github.com/SciCrunch/scibot, which is a web-based tool that is initiated by the curator, that reads the paper, finds any strings that match \u201cRRID\u201d and submits the identifier to the scicrunch resolver, https://scicrunch.org/resolver. The output of the process is submitted to Hypothes.is as an annotation and becomes data that are available for users of the resolver. For example, the antibody https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_331646 is associated with 39 papers. The assertion that a resource is used in a paper is available also via the publication resolver e.g., https://scicrunch.org/28235199.

This research aims at the detection of psychosocial stress using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The proposed scheme works by evaluating physiological variability between psychosocial stress and control conditions. For acquiring physiological signals, eleven subjects solved mental arithmetic tasks under stress in an experimental paradigm which had four successive levels of task difficulty. Power ratios from EEG frequency bands were extracted in every level. Average heart rate, powers in high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) and LF/HF were extracted from ECG signal in every level. A paired t-test was applied on the extracted features to select significantly varying features. The selected features were normalized by their respective means and then fused to form a combined feature set in every level. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the fused feature set for dimensionality reduction. Feature set of every level was applied to support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation to detect psychosocial stress. The results showed a maximum 92.45% accuracy of detecting psychosocial stress. In conclusion, EEG and ECG have potential to objectively quantify stress into multiple levels.

Here, we report on an in-progress platform called NeuroScout that enables researchers to rapidly test novel theoretical hypothesis using openly available fMRI datasets. NeuroScout reduces the burden of re-use by providing a flexible and user-friendly front-end for model creation (Figure 1A) while leveraging existing open-source neuroimaging projects (e.g. BIDS, NiPype and NeuroDebian) to automate the analysis and deploy computation to the cloud (Figure 1B). Additionally, we provide a highly extensible framework for multimodal stimulus annotation and extraction (\u201cPliers\u201d; http://github.com/tyarkoni/pliers) that interfaces with state-of-the-art deep learning services and enables researchers to rapidly extract stimulus features relevant to novel theoretical hypotheses. Finally, we aim to incentivize the use of NeuroScout by seamlessly integrating analysis results with a broader ecosystem of data sharing, visualization and interpretation platforms, such as NeuroVault and Neurosynth (Figure 1C), via a publicly accessible API. When the current prototype is fully deployed, NeuroScout will provide a turnkey solution for extremely rapid analysis and visualization of existing fMRI data at a marginal cost very ", "authors": [{"uuid": "1fd13101-aedf-4670-930d-d9e9421478c9", "firstName": "Alejandro", "middleName": null, "lastName": "de la Vega", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "delavega@utexas.edu"}, {"uuid": "cd6a6503-cb3b-4df2-b222-61eb545f0678", "firstName": "Quinten", "middleName": null, "lastName": "McNamara", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "quinten.mcnamara@utexas.edu"}, {"uuid": "3a6a395f-0350-4ef1-a4db-5ce172d7decd", "firstName": "Michael", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Hanke", "affiliations": [1], "position": 2, "mail": "michael.hanke@ovgu.de"}, {"uuid": "cedfb294-abc7-4d0d-8a61-3e7f1b6ad8fd", "firstName": "Tal", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Yarkoni", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "tyarkoni@utexas.edu"}], "sortId": 131075, "topic": " Neuroimaging", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "5ad8c96a-50a3-4dd0-99e8-68f06943a0cc", "country": "USA", "section": "University of Texas at Austin", "address": "108 E Dean Keeton, Austin, TX", "department": "Department of Psychology", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "8629992d-ede5-42ec-8eef-8ba8a913cf14", "country": "Germany", "section": "Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg ", "address": "Universit\u00e4tsplatz 2, 39106, Magdeburg", "department": " Natural  Sciences Institute of Psychology", "position": 1}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 2, "short": "IP", "uuid": "27383566-b591-4484-bd09-294ab13f8adb", "name": "Investigator Presentation"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/18e57eb0-9391-4b75-921a-fb73ae534a3f/image", "caption": "Figure 1.

However, a bottleneck exists in the absolute number of components (synapses, neurons, ...) that can be modeled without involving the hard-disk. As soon as this threshold is exceeded, performance decreases drastically. This is not always possible to avoid entirely, but worth mitigating if at all possible. As research increasingly relies on processing huge volumes of data, this issue demands attention. One strategy which addresses this is memory compression of data in memory (DRAM). Starting with a block of compressed data, we can employ decompressing algorithms to extract exactly as much of the data as are needed for the calculations [3]. This decreases the memory demands for large simulations and could salvage some performance when scaling up models.\n\nThis proposal exists to address this bottleneck within the Neuromapp program created by members of the Blue Brain Project team [1]. This project is split into research and implementation of in-memory compression along the lines of compression library selection, interface algorithm development, and block data structure design. The resulting compression mini-app is aimed at reducing this bottleneck, and providing accelerated calculation capacity for the suite of associated mini-apps that come with Neuromapp.\n", "authors": [{"uuid": "b30aecfd-70c2-4830-b041-388a97754146", "firstName": "Devin", "middleName": "R", "lastName": "Bayly", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "baylyd@email.arizona.edu"}, {"uuid": "de8597ee-c81f-47fb-9bd3-f71e8b71531b", "firstName": "Timoth\u00e9e", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Ewart", "affiliations": [1], "position": 1, "mail": "timothee.ewart@epfl.ch"}], "sortId": 196612, "topic": " Computing systems", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "d3e15032-4401-4db3-9dcd-c74d78821b4c", "country": "US", "section": "University of Arizona", "address": "Tuscon, AZ 85721", "department": "NSCS Department", "position": 0}, {"uuid": "34f3e170-2c47-4ab9-a113-9bede146a3dd", "country": "Switzerland", "section": "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne", "address": "Geneva", "department": "Blue Brain Project", "position": 1}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 3, "short": "DI", "uuid": "ef44b70b-0d7a-4fed-a52a-ac09415dcdf5", "name": "Demo and Investigator Presentation"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:35.287Z", "references": [{"text": "Neuromapp: a Mini-Application Framework to improve Neural Simulators, Ewart et al, conference proceedings accepted for publication in Springer\u2019s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), ISC-2017", "doi": null, "link": "https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-58667-0_10", "uuid": "a4929371-8667-48a6-8a82-47252018cb82"}, {"text": "Neuromapp Github Repository", "doi": null, "link": "https://github.com/BlueBrain/neuromapp", "uuid": "1f566489-89fa-4761-a800-1983aa123fcf"}, {"text": "Zlib compression library", "doi": null, "link": "https://www.zlib.net/", "uuid": "d3972f7d-d7b7-4f67-8b8d-8b84ef9ae6ee"}], "acknowledgements": null, "conflictOfInterest": null}, {"conference": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/conferences/3b00ef16-84f7-49bf-878e-5dcc27479dbb", "owners": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/65a025b5-98e9-4d02-90fb-a1de14349c5e/owners", "doi": "10.12751/incf.ni2017.0055", "isTalk": false, "uuid": "65a025b5-98e9-4d02-90fb-a1de14349c5e", "stateLog": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/abstracts/65a025b5-98e9-4d02-90fb-a1de14349c5e/stateLog", "title": "Automated Machine Learning-based diagnosis of impaired consciousness: cross-center and protocol generalization of EEG biomarkers.", "text": "To date, electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning begin to assist the diagnostics of post-comatose conditions of impaired consciousness after severe brain injury. Recent findings suggest that a variety of EEG-markers are of complementary diagnostic value and can act synergically through multivariate predictive modeling. However, it is unclear to which extent such models depend on specific EEG configurations or protocols, and an assessment of bias and generality through application to independent data is pending. Here we probed the capacity of EEG markers of consciousness and predictive models to discriminate the unconscious from the minimally conscious patients, using different sensor configurations and recording lengths from 141 EEG. Moreover, we demonstrated prospective validity by testing our model on new data (n=108) and observed negligible cross-validation bias. Furthermore, our model could generalize to\u00a0resting state\u00a0clinical routine\u00a0EEG from an independent clinical center (n=48), suggesting that it captures consciousness-specific patterns. These findings imply that EEG signatures of consciousness can be reliably extracted from different contexts and combined into coherent predictive models, encouraging future efforts in large-scale data-driven clinical neuroscience.

Graph theory is the standard method to analyse brain connectivity quantitatively [1], however, graph theoretical measures describe the network as a whole but not individual connections. The cause of brain diseases can in many cases be attributed to alterations in specific connections [2] but available tools so far provide little support for clinicians and scientists for connectivity analysis. We used the NeuroXM\u2122  knowledge management suite for neurological data (Biomax Informatics AG, Planegg) to organize and store connectivity matrices from DTI and fMRI imaging and link this data to gene expression in post-mortem brain tissue from the Human Allen Brain Atlas [3]. We took fMRI and DTI example data sets from the Human Connectome Project [4]. NeuroXM deploys semantic networks and an own query language for data integration and reporting that enables the automatic annotation of the individual connectome by any type of -omics data from public or proprietary sources. The underlying semantic network can be easily adapted to dynamically changing available data sources to embed new brain atlases, ontologies and reference data. We are convinced that linking -omics data to neuroimaging data enable new integrated analysis of the patients\u2019 connectome and a better understanding of brain disorders.", "authors": [{"uuid": "4cac7d89-30b6-4ec6-81d5-e27dd4ab87ca", "firstName": "Markus", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Butz-Ostendorf", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "markus.butz-ostendorf@biomax.com"}], "sortId": 196621, "topic": " Neuroimaging", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "a1e7636f-2f8c-4b7f-9028-59d164d2162a", "country": "Germany", "section": "Biomax Informatics AG", "address": "Robert-Koch-Str. 2", "department": null, "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 3, "short": "DI", "uuid": "ef44b70b-0d7a-4fed-a52a-ac09415dcdf5", "name": "Demo and Investigator Presentation"}], "figures": [{"URL": "https://abstracts.g-node.org/api/figures/51fc35b3-eebc-4f79-8613-351acfa5e86d/image", "caption": "With NeuroXM, we can merge connectome information from fMRI and DTI with gene expression data.

We aim at (1) quantifying the effect of operating system version updates on biological results and (2) identifying the software tools in a pipeline that are responsible for this effect. We focus on the pre-processing of data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) [2].\n\nWe used raw data from 10 subjects in the HCP S500 Release Subjects. The HCP pre-processing pipelines (v3.19.0) were executed in Docker containers created from CentOS versions 5.11, 6.8 and 7.2. We deployed the containers on servers using CBRAIN [3]. File checksums were recorded before and after execution to check for file corruption. For each subject, pre-processing was repeated three times with each of the three CentOS versions to check for inter-OS and intra-OS differences.

However in order to make the best use of the data, it needs to be well catalogued, curated and include contextual meta-data (3). While the various clinical standards have been proficient at providing the relevant framework for regulatory submission (4), they offer limited capability in adequately describing the data semantics, especially relating to imaging data.\n\nWe explore the pertinence of adopting the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource (FHIR) standard for managing clinical research studies with an imaging component. We are particularly keen to investigate the potential for virtual studies whereby clinical and research data can be reused to answer new questions. Consequently, we propose a FHIR-based data model to support imaging-focussed research studies that highlight the Study, Subject, Event and Experiment hierarchy.\n\nWe demonstrate the modularized approach proposed with a case study showcasing a standardised dictionary and standardised processes relating to the collection, management and sharing of the data. Our motivation is to demonstrate that, using extensions and profiling, the FHIR standard has the potential to become a one-stop-shop for clinical research data management (3).", "authors": [{"uuid": "7e775ae9-fb28-47e3-b3c3-6cc19c8870bf", "firstName": "Hugo", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Leroux", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "hugo.leroux@csiro.au"}, {"uuid": "c9f803e0-2914-40c2-9027-9b38ad7c0d38", "firstName": "Parnesh", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Raniga", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "parnesh.raniga@csiro.au"}], "sortId": 262194, "topic": "General neuroinformatics", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "8f2dccee-8c41-482a-8157-7fa6786f9a25", "country": "Australia", "section": "Health and Biosecurity, CSIRO", "address": "Level 5 UQ Health Sciences Building Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Herston, Queensland 4029", "department": "The Australian E-Health Research Centre", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 4, "short": "PI", "uuid": "ce87db8e-cdcd-428f-9221-e1535b9ef999", "name": "Poster and Investigator Presentation"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:36.334Z", "references": [{"text": "Warren, E., 2016.

However, this relatively untapped area remains underultilized in our medical fraternity. Our research project assessed the efficacy of teaching using 3D printed (3Dp) model registered to the real time navigation system (Brainlab Image Guided System (IGS)) versus teaching using conventional teaching methods in a prospective cohort study involving 6 participants with at least one month neurosurgical exposure. Accuracy of surface localisation points of extradural hematoma was compared pre and post teaching sessions. Accuracy of the points were assessed by 2 independent neurosurgeons. We found that 7.7% of the points were correctly placed during a 1 hour teaching module using conventional teaching methods compared to 84.6% of correctly placed points after an hour of teaching module using 3Dp models and IGS system. This increment was statistically signi\ufb01cant (p< 0.001). Post module questionnaire revealed 85% of the participants enjoyed the teaching module with 3Dp-IGS system and were very much con\ufb01dent in localising clots thereafter. We concluded that teaching using 3Dp models with real time navigation system markedly improves the performance of participants and will be a good adjunct to pre-existing conventional teaching methods.", "authors": [{"uuid": "631f4865-d6c5-4f41-b29a-42047ff0db10", "firstName": "Xinli", "middleName": null, "lastName": "You", "affiliations": [0], "position": 0, "mail": "dryou@protonmail.com"}, {"uuid": "cc086fb6-73f0-4705-b27a-14e120912c91", "firstName": "Boon Seng", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Liew", "affiliations": [0], "position": 1, "mail": "liew_bs@yahoo.com "}, {"uuid": "b6fd0219-5f38-4526-9c7d-7db5e3c4c338", "firstName": "Saiful Azli", "middleName": null, "lastName": "M.Nayan", "affiliations": [0], "position": 2, "mail": "mrsaifulazlihsb@gmail.com"}, {"uuid": "120d7d88-6a77-44ed-a0a9-a023d26eeff2", "firstName": "Azmin Kass", "middleName": null, "lastName": "Rosman", "affiliations": [0], "position": 3, "mail": "azminrosman@gmail.com "}], "sortId": 262196, "topic": "General neuroinformatics", "affiliations": [{"uuid": "a094d88d-716c-4d54-8791-26d2359b356f", "country": "Malaysia", "section": "Hospital Sungai Buloh", "address": "Sungai Buloh", "department": "Neurosurgery", "position": 0}], "state": "Accepted", "abstrTypes": [{"prefix": 4, "short": "PI", "uuid": "ce87db8e-cdcd-428f-9221-e1535b9ef999", "name": "Poster and Investigator Presentation"}], "figures": [], "reasonForTalk": null, "mtime": "2017-07-09T14:41:36.528Z", "references": [], "acknowledgements": null, "conflictOfInterest": null}]
